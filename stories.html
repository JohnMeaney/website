			<h2>
				My short fiction
			</h2>

			<p>
				My early short fiction appeared in Interzone magazine, with reprints in various
				anthologies. Eventually, I made time to write stories only when invited by editors
				of varying anthologies; more latterly, I've simply had to decline invitations. I still love the
				short story/novelette/novella form.
			</p>
			<h3>Lost In Splendour</h3>
			<p>
				A generation gap. A mission in trouble, on a world many lightyears from the intended destination. Will any 
				amount of sacrifice get the survivors home?
			</p>
			<p>
				The story appears in Mission Critical, ed. Jonathan Strahan, pub. Solaris (2019).
			</p>

			<h3>A Study In Shadow</h3>
			<p>
				Combines one of the central mysteries of Arthur Conan Doyle's life with the near-future investigations of a scientist
				into creating psychic phenomena using quantum technology.  She is a descendant of one of Mrs Emmeline Pankhurst's
				combat-trained sufragette bodyguards; yet the links between her and Doyle go beyond bartitsu and jiu-jitsu, to the
				tension and complimentarity between analytical reason and mystical transport.

			</p>
			<p>
				Published by the Birmingham SF Group as a chapbook for Novacon 41, November 2011
			</p>
			<h3>From The Heart</h3>
			<p>
				A story of Pilots, concerning destiny and love,
				the choices we make, and the consequences of leading a double life. Plus espionage,
				the infinite fractal city/world of Labyrinth, and violence at the heart of the galaxy...
			</p>
			<p>
				The story appears in The New Space Opera 2, ed. Gardner Dozois and Jonathan Strahan, pub. Eos (2009).
			</p>
			<h3>Emptier Than Void</h3>
			<p>
				High-tech telepathy in near-future Singapore. Black ops, dark matter and neuroscience collide.
			</p>
			<p>
				The story appears in Subterfuge, ed. Ian Whates, pub. Newcon Press (2008).
			</p>
			<h3>Necroflux Day</h3>
			<p>
				<em>Necroflux Day</em> is a story of a young boy still at
				school, a teacher with a troubled past, and a bereaved parent. It's set in the
				strange city of Tristopolis (as featured in Bone Song and Dark Blood), but with
				none of the novels' characters. Not a police procedural, but a Tristopolitan tale.
			</p>
			<p>It appeared in The Solaris Book of New Science Fiction v.3, ed. George Mann, pub.
				Solaris (2008), reprinted in The Year's Best Science Fiction and Fantasy: 2010 edition, ed. Rich Horton,
				pub. Prime Books.
			</p>
			<h3>Via Vortex</h3>
			<p>
				An alternate near-future history. Jonathan Wright, reviewing the story in SFX, wrote: <q>...holding up the British end, John Meaney's
				<em>Via Vortex</em> is built around a gory idea of how near-instant teleportation might be achieved.
				If we didn't know him better, we'd be worried...</q> 
			</p>
			<p>				
				Appearing in Sideways In Crime, ed. Lou Anders,
				pub. Solaris (2008)
			</p>
			<h3>Sideways From Now</h3>
			<p>
				<em>Sideways From Now</em> is a long novella set in the near future when telepathy is
				enabled by qPins. The inventor of now-global telepathy is a widower, though still
				young, and this is his love story, taking place in Dublin, London and New York.
				It's also a story of intrigue set in the royal court of the Clanking City, on an
				endless world where the city must keep moving (on its myriad legs) or die. This story
				pre-empted a speculation by philosopher Daniel Dennett, which is cool...
			</p>
			<p>
				Appeared in Fast Forward 1, ed. Lou Anders, pub. Pyr (2007)
			</p>
			<h3>Looking Through Mother's Eyes</h3>
			<p>
				<em>Looking Through Mother's Eyes</em> is a short story. Really. Usually I end up
				writing twelve-thousand-word novelettes or eighteen-thousand-word novellas... This
				time I kept it short and simple. Don't read this if you're 1) pregnant, 2) squeamish,
				or 3) just finished eating. 
			</p>
			<p>				
				Appeared in Futureshocks, ed. Lou Anders, pub. Roc (2006)
			</p>
			<h3>Lost Time</h3>
			<p>
				<em>Lost Time</em> is the second proper outing for Rekka Chandri, later in her life,
				with flashbacks to her childhood in India (and featuring the suttee pavilion designed
				to keep the population down). (Rekka first appears in Sharp Tang, is mentioned in
				To Hold Infinity and Resolution,
				and is prominent in the Ragnarok trilogy.) This was a strange
				story for me, because I first wrote it a long time back, but in the wrong voice. I had
				to put it aside for several years before taking it out and rewriting it scene by scene,
				keeping virtually every scene as it was, but describing it in different words. 
			</p>
			<p>				
				It appeared
				in Adventure vol. 1, ed. Chris Roberson, pub. MonkeyBrain Books (2005)
			</p>
			<h3>Diva's Bones</h3>
			<p>
				<em>Diva's Bones</em> became the beginning of Bone Song, written very differently. I
				used first person from Lieutenant Riordan's viewpoint, and his first name wasn't
				Donal. 
			</p>
			<p>		
				It appeared in Interzone 193 (2004), reprinted in Year's Best Fantasy 5, ed.
				David G. Hartwell &amp; Kathryn Cramer, pub. Eos (2005)
			</p>
			<h3>The Swastika Bomb</h3>
			<p>
				<em>The Swastika Bomb</em> is set in World War II, in a world where the genetic
				engineering revolution took place instead of the physics revolution. The hero is
				called Fleming, he introduces himself as James Brand, and Los Alamos is a biowarfare
				project... It's a WWII spy thriller, fun but also tragic. 
			</p>
			<p>		
				It appeared in Live Without
				A Net, ed. Lou Anders, pub. Roc (2003), reprinted in Best Short Novels 2004, ed. Jonathan
				Strahan, pub. Science Fiction Book Club (2004), and in Modern Greats of Science Fiction,
				ed. Jonathan Strahan, pub. iBooks (2006), also in Russian translation in Fantastika
				Esli,(2005) and in Czech translation in Ikarie.
			</p>
			<h3>Blood and Verse</h3>
			<p>
				<em>Blood and Verse</em> is narrated by a poet-assassin newly arrived on an ocean
				world, with his own sense of ethics and a centuries-old tradition to uphold. Somehow,
				it became the most Zelaznyesque of all my stories. 
			</p>
			<p>
				Appeared in Aeon Magazine 1 (2004)
			</p>
			<h3>Entangled Eyes Are Smiling</h3>
			<p>
				<em>Entangled Eyes Are Smiling</em> is funny, I'll have you know. It's set in
				near-future Chicago, with an Irish protagonist, a kind of telepathy, and a different
				view of science inspired by Wolfram's book on how theoretical science could model
				reality without using equations. 
			</p>
			<p>				
				It appeared in Interzone 190 (2003).
			</p>
			<h3>The Whisper Of Disks</h3>
			<p>
				Originally called <em>The Whisper Of Discs</em> (due to a copy-editor unaware of computing usage), this
				is the story of Augusta (Gus) from her poverty-stricken
				childhood in present-day Oxford, through to financial and scientific eminence. In
				contrast, in the 19th century, her ancestor Ada Lovelace gradually destroys her life.
				(Gus is mentioned in Resolution and features in Transmission and Resonance.) This
				story is hardly SF, apart from the opening and
				closing paragraphs. 
			</p>
			<p>				
				It appeared
				in Interzone 183 (2002) and was reprinted in The Year's Best Science Fiction, ed.
				Gardner Dozois, pub. St Martin's Press (2003)... and now <a href="TheWhisperOfDisks.html">here on the website</a>.
			</p>
			<h3>The Dreamlode</h3>
			<p>
				<em>The Dreamlode</em>, set on a world where ideas are tangible, focuses on a young
				seeker after truth. It's the story of his relationship with his damaged sister for
				whom he'll do anything; and it's really about the power of sibling love.
			</p>
			<p>
				It appeared in Interzone 158 (2000)
			</p>
			<h3>A Bitter Shade Of Blindsight</h3>
			<p>
				<em>A Bitter Shade Of Blindsight</em> features a different kind of space travel using
				"Scully Gates" which are nothing to do with the X-files, and are named after a real
				physicist. The story is set in Arizona, with a native American heroine, some discourses
				on Coyote the Trickster God as an aspect of physics (chaos), and a lot of information
				that is hidden from the reader, on the basis that it's all dark matter/energy that's
				behind what's going on. 
			</p>
			<p>				
				Interzone 110 (1996)
			</p>
			<h3>Parallax Transform</h3>
			<p>
				<em>Parallax Transform</em> featured Karyn McNamara and Dart... It's an earlier
				version of Karyn's Story within Paradox. 
			</p>
			<p>				
				It appeared in Interzone 89 (1994)
			</p>
			<h3>Timeslice</h3>
			<p>
				<em>Timeslice</em> depicted a world in which people live one day out of four. At
				midnight in each timezone, everyone is spat forward in time by a central system
				called the Scheduler. There are terrorists, anguish among families who were split
				up when the world went Timeshare... and a hero who's a ballet dancer. 
			</p>
			<p>				
				It appeared in
				Interzone 75 (1993)
			</p>
			<h3>Sharp Tang</h3>
			<p>
				<em>Sharp Tang</em> is a bittersweet story of alien cannibalism, and is the first
				appearance of Rekka Chandri, a novice field explorer for UNSA. (She appears in the
				later Lost Time, is mentioned in To Hold Infinity and Resolution, and is prominent in the Ragnarok trilogy &ndash; Absorption
				includes a rewritten version of this story.) 
			</p>
			<p>				
				Interzone 82 (1994), reprinted in
				The Best Of Interzone, ed. David Pringle, pub. Voyager (1997, UK) and St Martin's Press
				(1997, US)
			</p>
			<h3>Sanctification</h3>
			<p>
				<em>Sanctification</em> is about a young girl accepted into a strange monastery with
				far more power than you might expect. It's a tale designed to pull at your heart-strings,
				and in writing it, I found the beginnings of an ability to deliberately use deep
				emotion in storytelling. 
			</p>
			<p>				
				It appeared in Interzone 69 (1993) and in German translation
				(as Die Heiligung) in Die Verwandlung, ed. Wolfgang Jeschke, pub. Heyne (1996)
			</p>
			<h3>Spring Rain</h3>
			<p>
				<em>Spring Rain</em> was my first published story, a simple story of an old man in
				Japan who faces a challenge from the AI his son developed. It's really about fathers
				and sons. The father is called Akazawa, and his son works for a man called
				Sunadomari. Both men are ancestors of Tetsuo (in To Hold Infinity). 
			</p>
			<p>				
				It appeared in
				Interzone 61 (1992).
