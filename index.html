				I'm John Meaney, and I write science fiction, fantasy and thrillers. Welcome to my virtual home! Pull up a chair, and let's catch up on
				<a href="http://johnmeaney.blogspot.com">what's happening</a>.
			</p>
			<div>
				OUT NOW: <em>NEW JERUSALEM</em>
				<div class="insert_panel">
					<img src="images/covers/new-jerusalem-small.jpg" alt="New Jerusalem" />
				</div>
				<p>
					The year is 1962, in a different world. The setting is New Jerusalem: the free Jewish state, founded in 1948, 
					that occupies 15 percent of pre-war Germany. Cold war is a growing threat, made more likely by a neo-Nazi 
					resurgence in Outer Germany.
				</p>
				<p>
					David Wolf is a scientist and a spy, tragically in love with a woman who can never be his.
				</p>
				<p>
					When treachery, betrayal and weapons-grade uranium mix together, can one lone Wolf possibly save lives and a fragile peace from total annihilation?
				</p>
		</div>

			<div>
				<p>
					Also out... <a href="books.html#ragnarok"><em>THE RAGNAROK TRILOGY</em></a> in a new US/Canadian edition.</p>
				</p>
				<p>From across a cosmic void, the Darkness moves. At scattered points in human history, some individuals become 
					its tools, while others stand against them: Ulfr, a young Viking; Gavriela, pioneering physicist and World 
					War 2 cryptographer; Roger Blackstone, a 27th century mu-space Pilot.
				</p>
				<p>
					There are others, but will they be enough to save humanity's descendants a million years from now, 
					when the Darkness and its forces reach the heart of our galaxy?
				</p>

			Also out... <a href="books.html#strategy_pattern"><em>STRATEGY PATTERN</em></a> Case and Kat return in a new contemporary cyber thriller.</p>
				<a href="books.html#strategy_pattern">
					<img src="images/covers/strategy-pattern-small.jpg" alt="Case & Kat book 2" />
				</a>
			</p>
			<p>An explosive cyber attack kills two hundred innocent civilians. Just miles away, an unknown assassin murders the head of IACS, Britain's most secret cyber agency.</p>
			<p>Case and Kat - the agency's toughest, smartest operators - are desperate for revenge. For justice.</p>
			<p>But they'll need all their combat skills and cyber expertise to face a conspiracy of apocalyptic proportions, launched from the harsh Icelandic wilderness. Can two desperate people halt a global attack and avert World War Three?</p>
			<p>From award-winning author John Meaney, another mission for Case and Kat, drawing on Meaney's own experience of hardcore martial arts and leading-edge computing, and shadowy hints from the real-world special forces working the interzone between cyber and kinetic warfare.</p>

				<a href="books.html#tristopolis"><em>TRISTOPOLIS REQUIEM</em></a></p>
				<a href="books.html#tristopolis">
					<img src="images/covers/Tristopolis_Requiem_ebook_and_papaperback.jpg" alt="Donal Riordan book 3" />
				</a>
				<p>
				The cop: Donal Riordan, undead, imprisoned in a coffin below ground. The city: Tristopolis, gothamesque and baroque,
				its unchanging sky deep purple, its elevators propelled by indentured wraiths, and its power produced by necroflux reactors,
				fuelled by the bones of the dead.
				</p>
				<p>
				When powerful conspiracies threaten Tristopolis from the far side of the world, can a freed Donal find a way to stop them,
				and in the process find a reason to carry on existing?
				</p>
			<p>			
			<p>
			Also out... <a href="books.html#on_the_brink"><em>ON THE BRINK</em></a> brings a timely new look at the Cold War spy thriller. Russian
			technology, a computer heist in 1950s East Berlin, and more.</p>

				<q>John Meaney... a brilliant, inventive writer... Absorption is his most compelling and accomplished work yet...
				he may produce his masterpiece in The Ragnarok Trilogy...Absorption is the best hard science fiction Iï¿½ve read this year,
				well written, exciting, mysterious, full of interesting characters and ideas...</q> The Times, London
			</p>

			<p>
				For readers of my Tristopolis books, please note that Black Blood and Dark Blood are the
				<em>same</em> book, released under different titles	by different publishers, either side of the Atlantic. (If you buy books
				online, it's not obvious when you're buying a foreign import, which might be a different edition of something you already
				own.)

			<h2>
				What I do
			</h2>
			<p>
				I live in South Wales, write books, teach a little software engineering, and train six days a week in my dojo. (That's
				the big shed in my garden. Or wherever I happen to be.) Simple.
