				I'm John Meaney, and I write science fiction, fantasy and thrillers. Welcome to my virtual home! Pull up a chair, and let's catch up on
				<a href="http://johnmeaney.blogspot.com">what's happening</a>.
			</div><br>
			<div>
				<div>
					OUT NOW: <em>TRISTOPOLIS HOWLING</em>
				</div>
				<div class="insert_panel">
					<img src="images/covers/tristopolis-howling-small.jpg" alt="Tristopolis Howling" />
				</div>
				<div>
					From award-winning author John Meaney comes a thrilling tale of Tristopolis, a 
					Gotham-like city beneath perpetually dark skies, where the bones of the dead fuel 
					the reactor piles, indentured wraiths power the elevators, and daylight never 
					shines.
				</div><br>
				<div>
					There's no such thing as ghosts, not even in Tristopolis, and zombie detective 
					Donal Riordan knows it. So when his dead lover appears in his boxing gym, he 
					knows that something dangerous has arisen. But the threat facing him and his 
					new partner Mel, and perhaps the entire world, is of eldritch origin and far 
					more powerful &ndash; and stranger &ndash; than anything he's faced before.
				</div><br>
				<div>
					Without his former colleagues to help him, can he even survive the day? Or is Tristopolis doomed?
				</div><br>
			</div>
			<div>
				<div class="clear">Also out: <em>NEW JERUSALEM</em></div>
				<div class="insert_panel">
					<img src="images/covers/new-jerusalem-small.jpg" alt="New Jerusalem" />
				</div>
				<div>
					The year is 1962, in a different world. The setting is New Jerusalem: the free Jewish state, founded in 1948, 
					that occupies 15 percent of pre-war Germany. Cold war is a growing threat, made more likely by a neo-Nazi 
					resurgence in Outer Germany.
				</div><br>
				<div>
					David Wolf is a scientist and a spy, tragically in love with a woman who can never be his.
				</div><br>
				<div>
					When treachery, betrayal and weapons-grade uranium mix together, can one lone Wolf possibly save lives and a fragile peace from total annihilation?
				</div><br>
			</div>

			<div>
				<div class="clear">
					Also out... <a href="books.html#ragnarok"><em>THE RAGNAROK TRILOGY</em></a> in a new US/Canadian edition.
				</div><br>
				<div>From across a cosmic void, the Darkness moves. At scattered points in human history, some individuals become 
					its tools, while others stand against them: Ulfr, a young Viking; Gavriela, pioneering physicist and World 
					War 2 cryptographer; Roger Blackstone, a 27th century mu-space Pilot.
				</div><br>
				<div>
					There are others, but will they be enough to save humanity's descendants a million years from now, 
					when the Darkness and its forces reach the heart of our galaxy?
				</div><br>
				<div>

			<br>
			<div>
			Also out... <a href="books.html#strategy_pattern"><em>STRATEGY PATTERN</em></a> Case and Kat return in a new contemporary cyber thriller.
				<br><br>
				<a href="books.html#strategy_pattern">
					<img src="images/covers/strategy-pattern-small.jpg" alt="Case & Kat book 2" />
				</a>
			</div><br>
			<div>
				An explosive cyber attack kills two hundred innocent civilians. Just miles away, an unknown assassin murders the head of IACS, Britain's most secret cyber agency.
			</div><br>
			<div>
				Case and Kat &ndash; the agency's toughest, smartest operators &ndash; are desperate for revenge. For justice.
			</div><br>
			<div>
				But they'll need all their combat skills and cyber expertise to face a conspiracy of apocalyptic proportions, launched from the harsh Icelandic wilderness. Can two desperate people halt a global attack and avert World War Three?
			</div><br>
			<div>
				From award-winning author John Meaney, another mission for Case and Kat, drawing on Meaney's own experience of hardcore martial arts and leading-edge computing, and shadowy hints from the real-world special forces working the interzone between cyber and kinetic warfare.
			</div><br>

				<a href="books.html#tristopolis"><em>TRISTOPOLIS REQUIEM</em></a></div><br>
				<a href="books.html#tristopolis">
					<img src="images/covers/Tristopolis_Requiem_ebook_and_papaperback.jpg" alt="Donal Riordan book 3" />
				</a>
				<div>
				The cop: Donal Riordan, undead, imprisoned in a coffin below ground. The city: Tristopolis, gothamesque and baroque,
				its unchanging sky deep purple, its elevators propelled by indentured wraiths, and its power produced by necroflux reactors,
				fuelled by the bones of the dead.
				</div><br>
				<div>
				When powerful conspiracies threaten Tristopolis from the far side of the world, can a freed Donal find a way to stop them,
				and in the process find a reason to carry on existing?
				</div><br>
			<div>			
			<div>
			Also out... <a href="books.html#on_the_brink"><em>ON THE BRINK</em></a> brings a timely new look at the Cold War spy thriller. Russian
			technology, a computer heist in 1950s East Berlin, and more.</div><br>

				<q>John Meaney... a brilliant, inventive writer... Absorption is his most compelling and accomplished work yet...
				he may produce his masterpiece in The Ragnarok Trilogy...Absorption is the best hard science fiction Iï¿½ve read this year,
				well written, exciting, mysterious, full of interesting characters and ideas...</q> The Times, London
			</div><br>

			<div>
				For readers of my Tristopolis books, please note that Black Blood and Dark Blood are the
				<em>same</em> book, released under different titles	by different publishers, either side of the Atlantic. (If you buy books
				online, it's not obvious when you're buying a foreign import, which might be a different edition of something you already
				own.)

			<h2>
				What I do
			</h2>
			<div>
				I live in South Wales, write books, teach a little software engineering, and train six
				or seven days a week in my dojo. (That's
				the big shed in my garden. Or wherever I happen to be.) Simple.
