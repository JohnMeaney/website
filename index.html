				I'm John Meaney, and I write science fiction, fantasy and thrillers. Welcome to my virtual home! Pull up a chair, and let's catch up on
				<a href="http://johnmeaney.blogspot.com">what's happening</a>.
			</p>



			<p>
			NOW OUT... The new Donal Riordan book: <a href="books.html#tristopolis"><em>TRISTOPOLIS REQUIEM</em></a></p>
				<a href="books.html#tristopolis">
					<img src="images/covers/Tristopolis_Requiem_ebook_and_papaperback.jpg" alt="Donal Riordan book 3" />
				</a>
				<p>
				The cop: Donal Riordan, undead, imprisoned in a coffin below ground. The city: Tristopolis, gothamesque and baroque,
				its unchanging sky deep purple, its elevators propelled by indentured wraiths, and its power produced by necroflux reactors,
				fuelled by the bones of the dead.
				</p>
				<p>
				When powerful conspiracies threaten Tristopolis from the far side of the world, can a freed Donal find a way to stop them,
				and in the process find a reason to carry on existing?
				</p>
			<p>

			<p>
			Also out... <a href="books.html#on_the_brink"><em>ON THE BRINK</em></a> brings a timely new look at the Cold War spy thriller. Russian
			technology, a computer heist in 1950s East Berlin, and more.</p>

				</a>

			<p>
			<p>
			Plus... <a href="books.html#destructor_function"><em>DESTRUCTOR FUNCTION</em></a> is a contemporary cyber thriller, introducing no-first-name Case, and his
			intriguing - and somewhat scary - colleague Kat.
			</p>

				</a>

			<p>
			<p>
			My near-future thrillers <a href="books.html#edge"><em>EDGE</em></a> and <a href="books.html#point"><em>POINT</em></a>, the first two Josh Cumberland books, are also newly available.
			</p>
				<a href="books.html#edge">
					<img src="images/covers/EDGE_medium.jpg" alt="Josh Cumberland book 1" />
				</a>
				<a href="books.html#point">
					<img src="images/covers/POINT_medium.jpg" alt="Josh Cumberland book 2" />
				</a>
			<p>
			These are new, freshly revised editions of the books I previously published under the pen name of Thomas Blackthorne.
			</p>

				<q>John Meaney... a brilliant, inventive writer... Absorption is his most compelling and accomplished work yet...
				he may produce his masterpiece in The Ragnarok Trilogy...Absorption is the best hard science fiction I’ve read this year,
				well written, exciting, mysterious, full of interesting characters and ideas...</q> The Times, London
			</p>

			<p>
				For readers of my Tristopolis books, please note that Black Blood and Dark Blood are the
				<em>same</em> book, released under different titles	by different publishers, either side of the Atlantic. (If you buy books
				online, it's not obvious when you're buying a foreign import, which might be a different edition of something you already
				own.)
			</p>


			<h2>
				What I do
			</h2>
			<p>
				I live in South Wales, write books, teach a little software engineering, and train six days a week in my dojo. (That's
				the big shed in my garden. Or wherever I happen to be.) Simple.
			</p>
