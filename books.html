				Tristopolis Requiem
			</h2>

			<div class="insert_panel">
				<img src="images/covers/TRISTOPOLIS-REQUIEM.jpg" alt="Dark Blood" />
			</div>


			<p>
				The cop: Donal Riordan, undead, imprisoned in a coffin below ground. The city: Tristopolis, gothamesque and baroque,
				its unchanging sky deep purple, its elevators propelled by indentured wraiths, and its power produced by necroflux reactors,
				fuelled by the bones of the dead.
			</p>
			<p>
				When powerful conspiracies threaten Tristopolis from the far side of the world, can a freed Donal find a way to stop them,
				and in the process find a reason to carry on existing?
			</p>
			<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
			<h2>
				Dark Blood (UK title) Black Blood (US title)  ...Donal Riordan book 2
			</h2>


			<div class="insert_panel">
				<img src="images/covers/dark_blood.jpg" alt="Dark Blood" />
				<img src="images/covers/black_blood2.jpg" alt="Black Blood" />
			</div>

			<p>
				Lieutenant Donal Riordan is no longer the man he was... but to conspirators who
				threaten the civic order of Tristopolis and the rights of non-human sentients,
				he is an enemy who needs to be silenced. Even the most powerful of cities can change
				its character when the circumstances are filled with enough paranoia and fear.
			</p>
			<p>
				And when the conspiracy's international dimensions become clear, Donal must travel
				to Illurium, not just to Silvex City, the city that stands on vast glass planes, but
				further, to places unlike Tristopolis, yet just as strange.
			</p>

			<p>
				<q>One thing Dark Blood doesn't do is let you relax... In places it's a bloodbath appropriate to the
				title, and as John Meaney follows his take on magic's equivalent of nuclear technology through to its
				logical conclusion he creates one of the most satisfying border crossing fusions of Dark Fantasy,
				Horror and hard Science Fiction in years... before hitting us with a twist ending straight out of
				Edgar Allan Poe.</q> Anthony Brown, Starburst
			</p>
			<p>
				<q>John Meaney's city of Tristopolis... is a vivid and fascinating creation, first displayed in Bone
				Song, now revisited in Dark Blood. The sequel unravels more of the conspiracy revealed in the first
				book, only now the detective hero is dead - or, rather, undead, having been revived as a zombie - and
				facing the possibility that new legislation will strip human rights from him and all other undead
				citizens. Meaney entertainingly merges the police procedural with science fantasy in its most Gothic
				mode.</q> Lisa Tuttle, Times (London)
			</p>
			<p>
				<q>Dark Blood is highly entertaining, more action driven and seasoned with splatters of the titular
				liquid.</q> Andrew Osbourne, SFX
			</p>
			<p>
				<q>Over the course of two books, Meaney has successfully integrated the tricks of horror with the
				techniques of crime and SF. The surface of this series is horror, but it is only skin deep. These books
				have the comfort of rationality. The flesh of Dark Blood is that of a detective novel. This can be
				difficult to manage convincingly in science fiction, but the hard work of building the universe in the
				first book is repaid here: we now have a conception of normality within the setting so we can seek
				clues ourselves and attempt to get ahead of Riordan. As with any good detective novel, flicking back
				through the pages shows how many clues were there. The bones of the books, meanwhile, confirm a
				scientifictionally coherent universe within this endeavour. More than the clues for detective readers,
				I got a great deal of pleasure out of the hints for astronomy fans, of which I will say no more to
				allow like-minded readers their own enjoyment.
				<br /><br />
				And there is more to come, with plenty of swearing and action too, given the kicker of a cliffhanger
				on the last page.</q>Duncan Lawie, Strange Horizons

			<p>
				Imagine a city named Tristopolis, where tall towers rear beneath a dark, indigo sky,
				gargoyles glide overhead, while purple cabs drive along the streets. Elevators are
				powered by boundwraiths. Warmth and power come from reactor piles, deep inside Energy
				Authority complexes, where the bones of the dead are stacked. Necroflux replays the
				fragmented memories and feelings of two thousand corpses in each reactor, producing
				a chaos of mixed identities and suffering that the living would rather not know about.
			</p>
			<p>
				Tough cop Lieutenant Donal Riordan is assigned to protect a visiting diva, Maria
				daLivnova, who may be a target for those who collect the bones of great performing
				artists.
			</p>
			<p>
				But the dark cult is more powerful and secretive than anyone, even Donal's non-human
				allies, can suspect. And he has been touched by the bones.

				the start of a series, and a very welcome start.</q> Starburst
			</p>
			<p>
				<q>A remarkable book featuring a unique dark fantasy/SF world and great writing. The
				police procedural plot, creepy technology, and seamless, fascinating world make it a
				real page-turner, full of great twists and details. <em>Bone Song</em> has really got
				it all: fantasy, horror, science fiction, cops, crime -- even a love story and a dose
				of dark, dry humor. A great read and I can't wait for the next one.</q> Kat Richardson,
				author of <em>Greywalker</em>
			</p>
			<p>
				<q>John Meaney brings a city of death to richly textured life. In an amazing blend of
				noir mystery and dark fantasy, Meaney doesn't just build a world -- he creates an eerie
				culture that you can truly visualize and feel. <em>Bone Song</em> is a thrilling and
				suspenseful beginning to a great new series.</q> Mark Del Franco, author of <em>Unshapely
				Things</em>
			</p>
			<p>
				<q>It's not often that you open a book expecting a good science fiction mystery
				crossover and find yourself blown away by a world that's so multidimensional and
				textured that you have to keep looking up from the pages to make sure the sky is blue
				and the lights are on. The setting was so foreign, alien really, that it's hard to
				believe just how real it seemed. It seems that greed, power, lust, and cruelty are
				concepts that bridge the gap between our world and others -- to make the story come
				alive.
				</q>
			</p>
			<p>
				<q>There's many books that tell a compelling story with realistic characters and a
				satisfactory end. There's many books that we say we couldn't put down. This book is
				one of those but it's also a story that doesn't let you walk quietly away when you
				close the book on the last page, because it's going to linger in your thoughts and
				your dreams -- the ideas, the relationships, and the people are memorable because of
				who they are and what they are willing to do to make the world a better place.

				Introducing Case.
			</p>

			<p>
				When terrorists use cyber attacks and lethal bioweapons, who is going to defend you? Keyboard warriors? Intelligence officers? Special-forces operators? More often than the public knows, we need them all.
			</p>

			<p>
				Sometimes the cyber geek, the spy and the fighter are the same man. Or woman.
			</p>

			<p>
				When his best friend Fuad commits suicide on his wedding day, it seems unconnected to Case's investigation of cyber intrusion at a NATO airbase. But Fuad was a security specialist at a London bank, and a near-identical suicide inside the Air Force begins a hunt that leads from idealistic hackers in Berlin and Stockholm to manipulative psychologists and organized crime within the Moscow establishment, and a stolen Soviet-era virus without vaccine or antidote. But behind them all lies a combat jamaat, a jihadist group whose first target is going to be London, with a death toll that may eventually reach millions.
			</p>

			<p>
				Can Case and his formidable senior partner Kat, both operatives of IACS - pronounced Eye-Axe - track down and stop the threat before masses of 	people begin to die?

			Josh Cumberland’s daughter lies in a coma she will never wake from. He can’t help her, but perhaps he can save someone else.
			</p>
			<p>
			This is near-future Britain: storms, flash whirlwinds and floods. A legalized knife culture. And a missing rich schoolboy, whose buried memories hold the key to political corruption at the highest levels.
			</p>
			<p>
			Josh is a cyber specialist, ex-special forces and relentless. Can he pull a country and a world back from the edge of disaster?
			</p>



			<p>
				<q>Cumberland leaps off the page, a trained killer whose anger and grief at his daughter's condition
				is brilliantly portrayed; the depiction of his simmering rage, barely held in check, and how he
				channels it, provides a masterclass in characterisation.</q> Eric Brown, The Guardian
			</p>
			<p>
				<q>What starts off as a simple missing persons enquiry develops into a full-blown coup against a
				fascist state... Set in a Britain extrapolated from today's violent streets, yet still highly recognisable,
				Edge is the first in what will hopefully be a long running series.</q> Paul Simpson, Total Sci-Fi
			</p>
			<p>
				<q>The technology is very clearly described and completely believable while John's knowledge and
				research of martial arts is quite astounding. He manages to create a very rich vision of a future
				Britain that is disturbingly close to being quite likely.</q>
			</p>
			<p>
				<q>The characters themselves are wonderfully fleshed out and their interaction is quite mesmerising...
				John (or should I say Thomas Blackthorne) has created a dark, believable vision of a (near) future

				unexpected but superbly scripted ending.</q> Antony, www.sciencefictionandfantasy.co.uk

			This is Josh Cumberland: ex-special forces cyber specialist, enraged by what happened to his daughter, in need of action to put things right.
			</p>

			<p>
			And this is his world: near-future Britain, climate catastrophe, and now a rash of suicides: teenagers in groups of 13, killing themselves with knives. Beneath it all, in the corrupt heart of the political establishment, malevolent technology reaches new heights - and depths.
			</p>

			<p>
			Can Josh pull the country and himself back from the tipping-point?
			</p>

			<p>
				<q>Within five pages...I was completely hooked... the perfect blend of action and science fiction...
				I can only hope that there will be more.</q> The Eloquent Page
			</p>

			<p>
				<q>I absolutely don’t want to live in the world Blackthorne has created. I didn’t want to in Edge (the first book in the
				series) and I most certainly don’t want to now. I do, however, want to read about it. It’s relentless and gripping, with a
				brilliant balance between the personal and the political... it doesn’t just contain violence - it explores the consequences.
				The characters are real and there is no physical action without a physical and emotional reaction. It could be our world,
				tomorrow. Except I truly hope it isn’t.</q> Gillian Polack, BiblioBuffet
			</p>

			<p>
				<q>Point follows on directly from the explosive finale of Edge... The novel feels very much like a seamless continuation,
				it's got the same fast pace, tight dialog and distinct voice. There is also the same harsh realistic and gritty feel and
				plenty of action... The plot itself is inventive, intriguing and has enough loops that you could cover them in tomato
				sauce and sell them in a tin. Rewarding to read as a stand alone or even better after you've read Edge, Point is a riotous
				tale of a near future Britain, vivid, defined and totally immersive.

			<p>
				In 8th century Norseland, a young warrior called Ulfr returns to his village where his comrades, under mesmeric compulsion, are slaying one of their own. In 1920s Zurich, a young Jewish woman, Gavriela Wolf, returning home from her first lecture at the ETH where Einstein 	studied, witnesses the first hint of fascist violence destined to sweep across Europe. On 27th century Fulgor, Roger Blackstone (son of a long-term spy, his nature as a mu-space Pilot hidden) perceives an evil that cloaks itself from everybody else.
			</p>
			<p>
				A million years from now, in an airless hall upon the Moon, decorated with shields and spears, Ulfr, Gavriela, Roger and others awaken in transparent bodies of living crystal, ready for the final battle. But in their normal waking lives, they will remember only fragments of far future meetings.
			</p>
			<p>
				Each of their stories is a chronicle of their century and more, as their time-separated lives and minds become ever more entangled, playing out their parts in a confrontation that began an epoch ago.
			</p>

			<p>
				<q>John Meaney has already made a name for himself in science fiction as a brilliant, inventive writer, and Absorption
				is his most compelling and accomplished work yet. If he can sustain the pace over two more books, he may produce his
				masterpiece in The Ragnarok Trilogy...Absorption is the best hard science fiction I’ve read this year, well written,
				exciting, mysterious, full of interesting characters and ideas...</q> The Times, London
			</p>

			<p>
				<q>'Absorption'... takes us from a thousand years in the past to half a billion years in the future with several stops in between. It's the kind of complex plot that means you have to pay attention, with multiple timelines and characters who interact only marginally. Very quickly, the subtle clues that link these different scenarios start to appear, leading to more and more 'a-ha!' moments when you suddenly make a connection. This makes it a very satisfying read, paying back the investment in time with interest...[A] great volume of space opera... I was thoroughly engrossed in the world that John Meaney has created. I look forward to the rest of the trilogy.</q> 	Gareth D. Jones, SFcrowsnest.com
			</p>
			<p>
				<q>Transmission is John Meaney’s latest epic SF Space Opera and spans thousands of years as various characters find themselves intertwined inexplicably through time.... The characters are well written, the world building is phenomenal and the pace as chapters switch from time zones is just right, keeping the tension levels up. The female characters are particularly strong and literally jump off the page, particularly the WWII code breaker Gavriela. The novel is also steeped in historical accuracy and authenticity.</q>  Theresa Derwin, Terror-Tree.co.uk
			</p>
			<p>
				<q>Resonance is a book driven by big ambitions. Meaney has penned a story that aims to be epic beyond even the level of Dune or similarly famed series. Furthermore, the amount of research that has gone into the book adds a surprising degree of credibility...</q>  Starburst Magazine

			<p>
				Nulapeiron: a world isolated for twelve centuries, whose ten billion inhabitants live
				in subterranean strata whose upper levels, dwellings of the aristocratic classes, boast
				organic technologies and the use of Oracles whose ability to foresee their future is
				a most useful curse.
			</p>
			<p>
				Tom Corcorigan is young and impoverished, witness to the death of a mysterious woman
				who may be one of the legendary Pilots, and soon to be thrust into dreadful suffering,
				and servitude among the logosophically trained ruling classes. He will prove to be
				brilliant, though physically and psychologically flawed: poet, revolutionary, and more.
			</p>
			<p>
				He needs to avenge himself against an Oracle who foresees Tom's failure, to fight a
				corrupt system and the too-violent revolution that reacts against it, to find himself...
			</p>
			<p>
				Nulapeiron is a complex world with hundreds of different languages and cultures. The
				Oracles' abilities derive from genuine speculations about the true nature of time, a
				mystery at the heart of physics. Above all, the novel is about people, and the
				complexity of life, and the inevitability of unexpected twists in destiny.
			</p>

			<p>
				What the reviewers think:
			</p>
			<p>
				<q><em>Paradox</em> (and the whole Nulapeiron Sequence) is a glittering jewel in the

				trick of combining vivid world-building with hard-science rigor, like a collaboration
				between Jack Vance and Greg Egan at their creative peaks. I'm awe-struck by
				<em>Paradox</em>; John Meaney has single-handedly raised the bar for hard SF and

			<p>
				<q>Science fiction fans looking for the next big genre classic need look no further

				Meaney that has been (deservedly) compared to Frank Herbert's epic masterwork Dune.
				Meaney's Nulapeiron Sequence (Paradox, Context and the forthcoming Resolution) is a
				landmark work for multiple reasons: unparalleled world building, the world of
				Nulapeiron is one of the most vividly described and utterly unique realms ever
				imagined in the history of science fiction; plot density, like Nulapeiron's
				multi-leveled society, the story of Tom Corcorigan has innumerable layers; dozens of

			<p>
				Tom doesn't just have a wife -- he has a close friend, the bloody disembodied head of a
				Seer whose influence takes him to a place no one should be able to see. And for two
				decades, he has owned a Pilot's crystal, whose links across the centuries to the

			<p>
				Widowed Yukiko leaves Earth for a voyage to the paradise of Fulgor, the world that
				her son Tetsuo emigrated to, some years before. They have been estranged for such a
				long time, but Yukiko needs to make sense of her life. When she arrives on Fulgor,
				though, she finds a murder investigation in full swing, Tetsuo missing, and a society
				that is too advanced and fast-moving for even a talented scientist to understand and
				function in.
			</p>
			<p>
				Tetsuo's life on Fulgor has been hard. No unenhanced person can keep up with the
				electronically enhanced few who are known as Luculenti, able to create commercial
				empires in seconds and make plans covering timescales of centuries, and to traverse
				the virtual richness of Skein. He hadn't expected to deal with the elite; but the
				better Fulgidi merchants still have superior abilities, driven by the presence of
				Luculenti. That is why Tetsuo has resorted to illegal activity, making use of his
				family background and his knowledge of mu-space communications technology. But one of
				his associates is a far more dangerous person than he could ever suspect.
			</p>
			<p>
				Luculentus Rafael Garcia de la Vega is a psychopath, able to suck thoughts and memories
				from the electronically enhanced nervous systems of his fellow Luculenti -- both the
				living and the dead. He plays a predatory game, stimulated by the danger, growing
				ever more audacious.
			</p>
			<p>
				What Yukiko is plunged into is more than a homicide investigation, more than a hunt for
				her fugitive son. It plays out against a background of government conspiracy and
				widespread unrest, even on this, the richest of worlds.
