				 <b>Oxford, 2102</b> <br />
				So
				this is the city: millennium-old spires encased in clear ice,
				enwrapped by winter's gloom. There, the Bodleian Library, its elegant
				domed Radcliffe Camera gleaming beneath a transparent shell; there,
				the Ashmolean's stately grandeur, white snow banked at the stone
				columns' feet. The streets form ice-chasms where occasional bug-cars
				slide through softly falling flakes, navigating the whiteout by
				radar. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	  <i>I
				should never have left. Or never returned.</i> <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Augusta's
				vantage point is high: a curlicued smartglass tower, the ellipsoid
				hotel complex sitting at its apex. She is in the most expensive
				suite, with floor-to-ceiling convex windows. In the glass, her
				reflection, like a saddened ghost, overlays the ice-bound, moribund
				city. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Her
				long white hair is bound with platinum wire. Her shining pale-blue
				gown is high-collared &ndash; it keeps her warm &ndash; and falls in
				long straight elegant lines. Straight-backed, she stands, though her
				left hand holds a slender cane. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Unseen,
				within the formal garments, a slender exoskeleton provides the real
				support for her tired, narrow, pain-wracked body. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	  <i>You've
				been here longer than I,</i>
				she tells the ice-locked buildings silently.   <i>But
				we're both near the end.</i> <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	She
				might have spoken aloud, save for the small silver sphere which
				floats above her right shoulder: her official biographer. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	  <i>I've
				outlived my enemies. But that's no excuse for relaxing vigilance.</i> <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Instead,
				she snaps her fingers, places a call to her lawyers. Instantly &ndash;
				despite the fact that it is 4 a.m. in California &ndash; her chief
				legal officer comes on line. The head-and-shoulders image in the
				holovolume is system-generated (she can tell the difference), but
				then she has probably woken him up. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	  <i>Everything
				is different.</i> <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Outside,
				dull winter presses against the window. Since global warming finally
				tipped the North Atlantic convection cell, English winters are an
				Arctic hell. And she has grown to hate the cold; she should have
				stayed in California. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;I've
				decided. I'm going into space.&quot; She speaks with utter finality.
				&quot;I want to see, in person. To be there when the flight takes
				place.&quot; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;But&mdash;&quot;
				The lawyer stops, then: &quot;Yes, ma'am. I'll confirm the
				arrangements now. Oh, and Happy B&mdash;&quot; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;Good.
				Augusta out.&quot; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	  <i>No
				one dares to call me Gus anymore.</i>

				<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	But
				that is the least measure of her success &ndash; if it   <i>is</i>
				success. For she has outlived her friends, as well as her enemies.
				With a lonely decade, maybe two, ahead of her... if she strictly
				follows her medics' conservative, over-protective regimen. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Her
				name is Augusta Medora de Lauron (the surname from her seventh
				husband, which she has kept because she likes it), her personal
				wealth exceeds anything she ever dreamed of, and today is her one
				hundred and thirteenth birthday. <br />

				<br />
				<b>Oxford,
				1997</b> <br />
				When
				she was eight years old, she told her mother that her real name was
				Gus. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;<i>Augusta</i> sounds silly,&quot; she announced with great solemnity. &quot;And I'm
				not silly.&quot; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	She
				waved a spoon as if for emphasis. Dessert was a banana mashed up with
				a little milk &ndash; some sugar sprinkled on top, for the extra
				calories &ndash; and it was a favourite. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;Does
				Augusta sound silly?&quot; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Her
				mother &ndash; she still remembers this, a hundred and five years
				later, with a brightness and clarity denied more recent events &ndash;
				turned and stared out of the small, grimy kitchen window. Outside,
				the darkness of a cold winter's evening. Mother's face was lined,
				though she could not have been more than thirty, and she was very
				thin. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;You
				know&quot; &ndash; she turned to face her child, sitting at the
				cracked formica-topped table (an unforgettable egg-yolk yellow) &ndash;
				&quot;I do believe you're right, Gus.&quot; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Gus's
				face dimpled in a smile. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	When
				she had finished her mashed banana, she slid from the chair, and went
				to fetch her duffel coat while Mother washed up dishes in the big
				cracked sink. By the time Mother was ready to leave, Gus was already
				standing by the front door (whose paint was flaking, revealing
				silver-grey weathered wood: significant in retrospect, natural at the
				time), her duffel coat buttoned all the way up, her Buzz Lightyear
				satchel stuffed with books. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;You're
				a good girl, Gus.&quot; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;You're
				a good woman, Mum.&quot; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Mother
				bent down and they touched foreheads: their own private gesture which
				they had performed for as long as Gus could remember.	 <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;Come
				along, pumpkin.&quot; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Gus
				sighed, but it was a kind of joke: she   <i>liked</i>
				being called pumpkin, and she always had. Even though she was getting
				a little old for pet names. <br />
				<br />
				Outside,
				the streets were cold. Gus walked with her hand in Mother's, hurrying
				a little as the bus stop came into sight. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	There
				they waited, beneath the sodium-vapour streetlamp, in front of an old
				council house whose patchy hedge, black beneath the glowing orange
				light, scarcely concealed the tiny front garden, the discarded bath
				and broken parts of rusty lawnmower strewn across it. Finally the bus
				came, only ten minutes late; its pneumatic door wheezed open and Gus
				and Mother climbed inside. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	On
				her lap, Mother clutched the Safeway carrier bag she referred to as
				her 'executive briefcase'. Sometimes she would close her eyes,
				lightly dozing, though tonight she was not so tired. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Gus
				counted stops, keeping track of the route &ndash; &quot;We're on the
				ring road now, Mummy&quot; &ndash; as the bus circled the north of
				Oxford, and turned off into the small science park where Mother
				worked. They got off at the usual stop, and walked through the dark,
				empty car park (which in later years Gus would think of as a parking
				lot) to the locked entrance. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	  <i>Why
				is it always empty, Mum?</i>
				she had once asked.   <i>Because
				the important people,</i>
				Mother replied,   <i>have
				all gone home.</i> <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Inside
				the lobby, it was her favourite security guard &ndash; Uncle Eric with
				the big grey moustache &ndash; who signed them in. Her
				second-favourite was Big Fredo, who talked to Mother in Italian, which
				Gus did not understand, though she loved to listen to the flowing
				lyrical words. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	  <i>Are
				we important?</i>
				she had asked her mother. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	After
				a pause,   <i>Oh,
				yes,</i>
				Mother had replied.   <i>You,
				pumpkin, are the most important person of all. That's why they leave
				the office building empty, just for you.</i> <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;Hey,
				Louisa,&quot; said Eric. &quot;Good to know the real workers have
				arrived.&quot; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;I
				guess so. How's Esther?&quot; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;Just
				the same.&quot; A slow shake of the head. &quot;Just the same.&quot; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;See
				you later, then.&quot; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;I'll
				be here.&quot; Just as he always said: &quot;Same old same old.&quot; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Mother
				hung up her threadbare anorak, took the freshly laundered light-blue
				work-coat from her carrier-bag, and pulled it on. From the cupboard,
				she dragged out the big old vacuum cleaner, set the mop and bucket
				aside for later. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;Come
				along, pumpkin. Let's get set up.&quot; <br />

				<br />
				The
				wide, gleaming machine room was her domain.   <i>Machine
				room.</i>
				Gus had learned the name from one of the late-night computer
				operators, who used to chat with her before the night-shift had been
				cancelled. (<i>Because
				they finally automated the overnight run,</i>
				the woman said morosely.   <i>Even
				the back-up routine</i>.) <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	The
				place was clean, always cool, with a crispness to the conditioned air
				which Gus could almost taste. Sometimes she stuck out her tongue &ndash;
				when there was no adult to see &ndash; and tried to lick the
				dust-free atmosphere itself. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	The
				big desktop shone an eerie white beneath strong fluorescent light.
				All around stood row upon row of pale-grey and matte-black
				rectangular boxes: the Computers (the capital was obvious, whenever
				Mother talked about them) which kept the business going. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Gus
				had learned to program in Logo when she was six years old, on the
				cracked BBC Acorn at the back of her form-room in school, on a
				decades-old table bearing the scratched initials of long-forgotten
				pupils. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	By
				this time, aged eight, she knew the difference between program and
				data, between processor and disk. Gus was aware that the boxes
				discreetly labelled System/38 (that was an old one, battered by now),
				AS/400 and RS/6000 were processor units; the majority of the rest were
				disk drives. Row upon row of them, like tall refrigerators, stacked
				inside with spinning disks. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Once,
				one of the other cleaning ladies who worked with Mother had unplugged
				a disk drive &ndash; so she could plug in her vacuum cleaner &ndash;
				and the next night the cleaners' supervisor had arrived and taken her
				off to one side (&quot;<i>For
				a quiet word,</i>&quot;
				he claimed). The woman left in tears; neither Gus nor Mother saw her
				again. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Since
				then, the cleaners had been under strict instructions never, under
				any circumstances, to venture inside the machine room where the
				Computers (with a capital C) were kept. But no one had ever changed
				the lock-code &ndash; X and Y together, then 3-2-Z, before turning
				the dull steel knob in what felt like the wrong direction &ndash; so
				Mother had found the best place of all to keep Gus safe while she
				worked. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;Get
				out your books, pumpkin.&quot; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;Okay,
				Mum,&quot; she said as always. &quot;I'll be good.&quot; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	And
				then she was alone. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	It
				was true that she read the books. And that they were a mixture of
				titles, from   <i>War
				and Peace</i> to G.A. Dickinson's <i>Algebraic
				Secrets</i>,
				which were too advanced for an eight year old, though her mother only
				half-realised this. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	But
				often Gus would slip down from the operator's swivel chair, leaving
				her open books before the consoles, and simply sit cross-legged on
				the floor-tiles, staring at the rows and rows of black and grey
				boxes. And listening. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	For
				at night, disks whisper their secrets to those with ears to hear. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Susurration.
				A breathing, a soft chaotic overlay of nearly-words, of
				almost-conversation, as if she eavesdropped upon a salon-full of
				ghosts from centuries gone by: with everything to gossip of, but no
				breath to speak. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Sometimes,
				they moan. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	But
				mostly the indeterminate sounds formed overlapping whispers from
				beyond, whose words would never coalesce into meaning, yet whose
				message would haunt Gus-who-grew-into-Augusta forever. <br />

				<br />
				<b>Ashley
				Combe, 1843</b> <br />
				Upon
				the wall, a gaslight hisses, incandescent. Ada lies back upon the
				chaise-longue, dabbing a dampened cloth on her too-pale forehead. On
				the dainty table beside her lies a small pile of notes scribbled in
				black ink, with loops and scrawls surrounding the strange equations,
				and scraps of verse &ndash; forbidden verse! &ndash; in her scratchy
				handwriting. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	And,
				on one of those sheets, something new: an ink-drawn table with
				numbered, imperative steps of logic. Slow, for a person to work
				through those iterative commands: yet in her mind, burning with
				fever, it is Babbage's gleaming Engine which is alive with the
				pseudo-thoughts she has created; it is polished cogs and shining rods
				which click and spin more surely than too-weak mortal flesh,
				undermined by moral frailty or feminine weakness. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	  <i>The
				Pattern beneath the world...</i> <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Is
				she mad? Can she, a mere woman, be the first to have deduced the true
				possibilities of Babbage's calculating engines? Can she, for all her
				disadvantages, her cursed beginnings, truly perceive the power of
				mechanical minds? <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	For
				she has written the devil's code, logical steps which will execute
				within the power-realm of brass and steel, in stately sequence as
				exact and elegant as an evening's program at a debutante's ball. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;<i>But
				I am the Silver Lady...</i>&quot;
				Her whispered voice trembles. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	For
				the laudanum's magic is upon her. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	In
				her vision, she herself is Babbage's automaton: the scandalous Silver
				Lady with which he entertains his rich and famous guests. That Silver
				Lady of which 'Lady M' complained in an open public letter: an
				artificial woman whose garments were too diaphanous for polite
				society.	But in Ada's dreams, it is she who is semi-clothed, with
				Babbage's rough hands upon her. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	  <i>O,
				my father! It is your Dark Nature which calls to me...</i> <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	For
				all that her mother tried to whip the influence from Ada, Lord
				Byron's spirit is within her core, tempted by all that is lascivious
				and compelling. <br />

				<br />
				Then
				a voice penetrates the heavy dream &ndash; &quot;O, my beloved
				Beauty&quot; &ndash; and for a moment she thinks it is William, her
				too-tame ingenuous husband. But no, he is away in London; it is her
				dear friend, John Crosse, who takes her hand and presses it to his
				lips. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;Sweet,
				my prince...&quot; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	His
				hands are within her garments. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	But
				her mind's eyes is filled with other sights: coils and bubbling
				vessels, the strange electromagnetic experiments of Crosse and
				Faraday, the very real mysteries they have explored. And this man, in
				whose arms she moans, is the son of Faust: for his father Andrew has
				  <i>generated
				life</i>
				from electricity. Society is ablaze with the news. After leaving his
				electrolytic apparatus bubbling for three weeks, he has found tiny
				animalcules on one of the electrodes. Life, from base inanimate
				matter. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	And
				Faraday, her other hero in this scientific age, has Ada's portrait
				hanging prominently on his wall. Does she inspire him, even as his
				rough-hewn manner and sparkling intellect fire her imagination? <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Inside,
				she burns. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 	Crosse
				moves upon her &ndash; &quot;My darling, my Queen of Engines,
				Enchantress of Numbers&quot; &ndash; repeating the title which
				Babbage gave her, and has now become their own. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 	She
				cries out with pleasure, not caring if the servants overhear. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;My
				good Doctor, creator of Life, bearer of Fire&mdash;&quot; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	A
				dark-blue glass bottle, lying on its side upon the rug, has become
				unstoppered. Precious drops of liquid escape, evaporate. Their heady
				vapour incenses the wild, drugged atmosphere which already pervades
				the drawing-room. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	  <i>The
				Pattern...</i> <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Yet
				there is unease beneath her happy, chaotic delirium, as though Ada
				already senses the new life quickening inside her. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	But
				she is captivated by logical symbols, drawn in fire within her mind,
				enraptured by the notion that she &ndash; Augusta Ada Byron, Countess
				of Lovelace, eternally cursed daughter of mad, bad, dangerous-to-know
				Lord Byron (whose incestuous liaison with his own sister Augusta,
				after whom Ada in all innocence was christened, is the scandal which
				drove him finally from England) &ndash; has been vouchsafed a vision
				both divine and mad, of gleaming polished power beyond the strict
				confining world, and she cries out as she pulls her scientific lover
				to her sinful bosom once more. <br />

				<br />
				<b>Oxford,
				1998</b> <br />
				At
				the age of nine, Gus was still too young to travel to the library by
				herself &ndash; &quot;Not in these godforsaken days,&quot; as Mrs
				Arrowsmith who lived next door would say &ndash; although, once they
				were there, Mother would let Gus roam among the bookshelves without
				supervision. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Sometimes,
				if Mother was very tired, they would walk from home out to the Park &amp;
				Ride car park, where they could pretend they had left their car (the
				one they didn't own, that didn't exist) so that they could ride the
				bus for free. (Was there some kind of ticket Mother should have
				shown? Gus would wonder later, when she was older, whether there had
				been a particular, charitable driver.) Most times, though, they
				caught the normal bus or simply walked. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Once
				in the library, Mother would stay in the reading-room, among the
				reference books and periodicals, and sit drowsing in the warm
				surroundings. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	One
				October night, she regarded the pale fog thickening outside the
				windows &ndash; it was 4 p.m. on a Saturday, and she was not working
				tonight: there was no place to go &ndash; and thought about home, of
				sun-drenched hills and the clamour of noisy, cheerful neighbours, and
				wondered again why she had ever come to this cold country. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	In
				front of her, this week's   <i>New
				Scientist</i>
				was open. She flicked through it, barely understanding what she read.
				Sometimes she tried to read <i>Nature</i>,
				a real scientific journal which the library dutifully stocked. None
				of it made sense, and yet if she half-drowsed, a strangely relaxing
				sensation of wonder settled over her like a blanket. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	This
				night, she craned her head to catch sight of her daughter &ndash;
				there, lost in a world of her own, wandering among books. Gus would
				pick enough to fill the limit on both their library cards. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	  <i>If
				only I had more time&mdash;</i> <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	But
				the Catherine Cookson would do her, Louisa, for a few weeks. She
				barely had the energy to read a page or two, last thing at night,
				before turning out the light and sliding into sleep in her narrow,
				lonely bed. <br />

				<br />
				Sometimes,
				Louisa glanced over the titles which Gus had picked. Once, she had
				tried to read a book by someone called George Eliot &ndash; knowing
				that the writer had been a woman, writing when only men could call
				professions their own &ndash; but the convoluted nineteenth century
				English was difficult. There was a man in the story who was talented
				and successful, but eventually strayed in society as he was overtaken
				by irrational desires for a Jewess, finally taking the socially
				disastrous step of converting to her religion. But, it turned out,
				the man's mother (though she had appeared 'true English') had been a
				Jewish actress, and the burning desires were his blood's true nature
				coming out&mdash; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	She
				had thrown the hideous book aside, disturbed for more reasons than
				she could name, and considered hiding the book where Gus could not
				read it. But then, Gus was sensible enough not to be swayed by the
				half-rationalised bigotry of another century.	There were Italian
				novels, and some Spanish ones &ndash; easy enough to read &ndash; but
				Louisa steered clear of them. They stirred thoughts of the home she
				had left fifteen years ago, and could never return to. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	She
				would stick to her Catherine Cooksons and her Danielle Steels,
				written in English she could understand, and forget
				the rest. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	  <i>I'm
				so tired&mdash;</i> <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Then
				someone was shaking her shoulder. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;Time
				to go home,&quot; the young man said, kindly. &quot;Your little
				girl's waiting.&quot; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	And
				his concerned thoughts were obvious:   <i>You
				should eat more, too.</i> <br />

				<br />
				In
				the reading-room's doorway, Gus was standing with her arms full of
				books. She grinned at her mother, showing the gap in the front where
				two neighbouring milk teeth had dropped out within days of each
				other. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;Sorry.&quot;
				Rubbing her eyes, she smiled at Gus. &quot;Got your books, pumpkin?&quot; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;Yes,
				Mummy.&quot; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	She
				took the books from Gus's arms and carried them to the counter, where
				the librarian could scan them through. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;Hmm.
				Abbott's   <i>Flatland</i>.&quot;
				He stamped the due-date inside. &quot;Not bad. But I don't know this
				Pickover chap. <i>Surfing
				through Hyperspace</i>.
				Is that good?&quot; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	He
				looked up at Louisa, but it was Gus who answered: <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;It's
				not bad. I like the stories.&quot; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Since
				it was a non-fiction book, the librarian chuckled, and winked at
				Louisa as though they were sharing a joke. But there   <i>were</i>
				stories inside, as well as strange science; Louisa had looked over
				Gus's shoulder the last time she had borrowed the book. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;Come
				on, pumpkin. Time to go home.&quot; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	The
				young librarian watched them as they left. <br />

				<br />
				Later,
				on the bus ride home, Gus tugged at Mother's sleeve and said: &quot;Why
				don't you marry him?&quot; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Mother's
				face froze. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;I'm
				sorry?&quot; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Gus
				knew the one topic she could never ask &ndash; would never get an
				answer on &ndash; was the subject of her father. But this was
				different. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;The
				man at the library. He likes you.&quot; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	For
				a moment, Mother was speechless. Then she shook her head, smiling
				sadly. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;Oh,
				no, Gus. I'm not good enough for him.&quot; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;But
				Mummy, you're&mdash;&quot; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;No,
				I'm not.&quot; Silence, then: &quot;But you... You're the most
				important person in the world, little pumpkin.&quot; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	And
				Gus, with a child's intuition, kept silent for the rest of the
				journey. She was tempted to open one of her story books &ndash; there
				was an old one with a bright yellow cover,   <i>Time
				is the Simplest Thing</i>,
				and she'd read the first two pages inside the library, with the pink
				telepathic alien blob, and saw immediately that it was brilliant &ndash;
				but she knew from experience that trying to read inside a moving bus
				would make her sick. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	And
				the waiting, she knew, would make the story even better. <br />

				<br />
				Over
				the next year, Mother would occasionally smile and nod to the nice
				man at the library, but they would never get into a real
				conversation. And then, one Saturday, there was no sign of him.
				Neither Gus nor Mother ever saw the man again. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Eleven
				years later, when she was twenty, Gus would finally discover her
				birth certificate &ndash; born in 1989 in St Mary's Hospital,
				Paddington, London &ndash; with her mother's name written in the
				appropriate spot: Louisa Annebella Calzonni. And, in the space for
				the father's name, nothing. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Nothing
				at all. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	And
				decades after that, when she had become one of the richest women in
				the world, she would hire private detectives, and even ask favours of
				official investigative agencies, including Interpol, to find out
				something of her origins. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	One
				enterprising team would eventually find the grave of a couple named
				Calzonni, whose daughter Louisa had disappeared in 1987, in a small
				village on the outskirts of Turin. But in whose company Louisa had
				disappeared, or whom she had travelled to meet, no one would ever
				discover. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Of
				her earlier ancestors, Gus would learn nothing. <br />

				<br />
				<b>London,
				1844</b> <br />
				Grey
				fog blankets the boulevard which is Pall Mall, causing the gas-lamps
				&ndash; the lamplighter is still on his rounds, can just be seen far
				down the street, at his work &ndash; to hiss in the damp, heavy air.
				The buildings are grand, doors fronted by columns in the
				neo-classical style: white-painted or pale grey, eerie in the
				fogbound night. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	There
				is a Peeler on duty, on the other side of the wide avenue, his tall
				rounded helmet lending him the appearance of a toy wooden soldier.
				But the long truncheon tucked in his leather belt, and the whistle
				for summoning help, are real enough. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	The
				anonymous man, Ada's messenger, half-hidden in a doorway and overly
				conscious of the pistol in his tweed coat's pocket, stands very
				still. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	  <i>Mistress...
				This is for my Countess.</i> <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Ada
				engenders such extreme reactions, in her servants as well as her
				peers: a total, smitten adoration; or a fearful loathing, as though
				her dark spiritual curse may be infectious. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>	Just
				wait... </i>
				<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	And,
				eventually, there is the clop of hooves: a disreputable-looking horse
				and cart passing through, heading towards Trafalgar Square. The
				policeman leaves his post to investigate. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	  <i>Now.</i> <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Ada's
				messenger, his face muffled against the fog and his hat pulled low,
				moves quickly but noiselessly across the cobblestones, and into the
				entranceway of the Aetheneum Club. Ignoring the shining brass
				knocker, he taps softly. After a long, tense moment, the big panelled
				door swings open. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	The
				footman nods in recognition, and leads the messenger inside. In the
				messenger's left hand is an envelope addressed to   <i>F.
				Prandi Esq</i>;
				he holds it up for the footman to see. A discreet cough, then another
				manservant gestures, and leads the messenger along a marble-tiled
				corridor, to a quiet gentlemen's snug at the rear. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	A
				knock, and the door is opened from within. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;Ah,
				my friend.&quot; A rotund man beams. His Italian accent, when he
				speaks, is scarcely detectable. &quot;Come in. Sit down.&quot; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	There
				is a reek of old cigarillos in the room, although no one is smoking
				at present. Books line the walls, and copies of   <i>Bentley's
				Miscellany</i>
				litter two small tables. A globe stands in one corner, beside a
				heavy, dark-green ceiling-to-floor drape. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;I
				am reading the most excellent serial&quot; &ndash; the round-faced
				Italian's smile flashes beneath his dark moustache &ndash; &quot;by
				your wonderful Mr Dickens. Whom I gather&quot; &ndash; lowering his
				voice &ndash; &quot;your esteemed mistress personally knows.&quot; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	The
				messenger's expression is stoic. His reply, when he makes it, carries
				the unmistakable burr of the Scottish Highlands. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;That
				I cannot say, sir.&quot; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;And
				what can you say?&quot; Irritation prickles Signor Prandi's voice.
				&quot;What, pray, is that in your hand?&quot; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;A
				letter, sir. Addressed to you.&quot; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	The
				messenger hands it over quickly, before the Italian can snatch it, or
				make disparaging comments about his mistress. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;Hmm...&quot;
				Tearing open the seal, Prandi flicks a glance over it. &quot;Not
				signed, I notice.&quot; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;She...
				Since the matter of the Royal Mail, sir...&quot; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	The
				Italian's private letters have been intercepted in the past: an
				absolute scandal to the British public who had assumed their personal
				correspondence was sacrosanct. But then, Signor Prandi is a known
				spy, and a foreigner. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;Don't
				worry.&quot; Reading the note more carefully, he adds: &quot;Do you
				know anything of this favour she wishes me to grant?&quot; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	A
				pause, then: <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;No,
				sir. I do not.&quot; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	But
				that hesitation told its own story. There is a flash of gold, as
				Prandi hands over two sovereigns. The messenger gulps, then secrets
				the coins in his waistcoat's watch-pocket. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;I
				only... The bairn'll need a wet-nurse, sir, if it is to survive.&quot; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;A
				  <i>child</i>  ?
				Ah, I see. Very good, my friend.&quot; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;Sir.&quot; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	The
				messenger gives a stiff nod, then leaves the small snug, closing the
				door behind him. <br />

				<br />
				After
				a decent interval, to make sure the messenger has left the club,
				Fortunato Prandi sits back in his overstuffed armchair, and uses the
				silver point of his cane to ruffle the green drape at the small
				room's rear. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;You
				can come out now, Aldo.&quot; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;Thank
				you.&quot; The drape is pulled aside, and a lean-faced man steps into
				the room. &quot;This message... It's from the countess?&quot; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;The
				very one.&quot; Prandi taps his teeth with the envelope's edge. &quot;And
				I wonder what kind of trouble she's in now.&quot; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	But
				they both heard the messenger's comment: there's a newborn child
				involved. The Countess of Lovelace has been touched by too many
				scandals in the past; one more would be disastrous. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;The
				countess knows&quot; &ndash; Aldo Guillermi's face is tightly drawn:
				his long hair and wide shoulders bespeak an athlete's grace, but his
				body is fairly vibrating with tension &ndash; &quot;of my sister's
				misfortune.&quot; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	How
				else would anyone associate an Italian spy with a wet-nurse? For
				Guillermi's sister Maria, so young and beautiful, has but recently
				lost her firstborn to a raging fever no English doctor could
				identify, no apothecary could cure. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;We
				spoke,&quot; says Prandi, still in English, &quot;in general terms,
				no more. The countess knows of your sister's plight, but not her
				identity.&quot; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;That
				is good.&quot; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	For
				a moment, as the two men face each other, it is not certain where the
				power in this room really resides. Then Prandi's glance slides away.
				Though he is nominally senior in the republican movement, his forte
				is solo, diplomatic espionage: moving among the drawing-rooms of the
				rich and the good, gleaning gossip, recruiting admirers. It is Aldo
				Guillermi who is the soldier, used to bearing the responsibility of
				command. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;Mazzini,&quot;
				he says, &quot;has mixed feelings about the current   <i>furore</i>  .&quot; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Guillermi
				pronounces the last word in the Italian way.	 <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;The
				republican cause&quot; &ndash; Prandi shakes his head &ndash; &quot;can
				only benefit.&quot; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Both
				Mazzini, the true figurehead, and Prandi are in exile: the public
				face of agitation. Prandi's work as a spy has been both hindered and
				helped by his now-public identity. Mazzini proved, to most
				intelligent readers' satisfaction, that the British Government caused
				their personal letters &ndash; his and Prandi's &ndash; to be opened
				by the supposedly untouchable Royal Mail. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Hence
				this handwritten note from Ada, which reads: <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	  <i>Dear
				Prandi. I have a more important service to ask of you, which only you
				can perform...</i>
				and goes on to arrange a rendezvous, without specifying the new
				favour's nature. Ada identifies herself anonymously, thus:   <i>I
				am the person you went with to hear Jenny Lind sing. I expect you at
				6&mdash; </i>
				<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;Your
				mother,&quot; adds Prandi, as Guillermi finishes reading the unsigned
				note, &quot;has raised more funds for the cause.&quot; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;It
				will be good to see her again.&quot; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Guillermi's
				mother is French, and France has been home to many for whom Italy is
				too hot a place to be in these troubled days. More than anything,
				Guillermi wants to remove his sister from this cold benighted
				country. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;Since
				Maria lost the child&quot; &ndash; his gaze turns bleak &ndash; &quot;I
				have feared for her sanity. And since her husband Higgs seems lost at
				sea...&quot; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;She
				had best set sail for southern France, where your mother can take
				care of her.&quot; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;Yes.&quot;
				Guillermi's hand goes to his hip as though to rest upon a sword-hilt
				which is not there. &quot;That would be best.&quot; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;And
				the Countess, it seems, needs a newborn child to disappear.&quot; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Guillermi
				looks at Prandi. The overweight spy looks unduly pleased with
				himself. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;How
				can you be so certain? There might be another explanation.&quot; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;Ah,
				my friend. It is not the first time&quot; &ndash; with a flashing
				grin &ndash; &quot;I have caused a member of her family to vanish.&quot; <br />

				<br />
				<b>Oxford,
				2001</b> <br />
				Gus
				was twelve in the December when she took home that end-of-term report
				card: the last report before everything changed. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	  <i>A
				withdrawn child,</i>
				the summary read,   <i>who
				needs to interact more with other children.</i>
				It was the kind of report which Louisa had come to expect. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	But
				there were one or two puzzled hints from other teachers, including Mr
				Brownspell who taught physics:   <i>Produces
				occasional flashes of surprising intuition, when she succeeds in
				engaging with the class at all.</i> <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	When
				the English teacher, Mrs Holwell, set an essay assignment on
				  <i>Inevitability
				in Daniel Deronda</i>,
				a novel the class had just read &ndash; by chance, the same Eliot
				book which Gus had borrowed, and her mother had tried to finish,
				several years before &ndash; Gus's reply was a long and flowing
				indictment of genetic determinism: eloquent and reasoned enough for
				suspicions of plagiarism to spring up in every adult who read it. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Worse,
				the essay contained equations and conceptual diagrams &ndash; of
				interconnected springs &ndash; forming a mathematical model of the
				interdependence of genes, and their developmental motion through a
				phase-space of genetic possibilities. It replicated some of Kaufman's
				work (which she could not have seen) from the Santa Fe Institute &ndash; <i>which
				is the nearest</i>,
				she said in the essay,   <i>we
				get to predetermined lives, and it's not close at all</i>
				&ndash;  and demonstrated the existence of broad constraints on the
				otherwise random, unimpeded arms-race of coevolving replicators. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;I
				got the idea,&quot; she told Mrs Holwell, &quot;from the Faraday
				lectures. On the telly.&quot; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	The
				English teacher, who had never heard of Richard Dawkins, was
				unimpressed. But she was sufficiently annoyed to show Gus's exercise
				book, during a break in the staff-room, to Mr Brownspell. And he was
				astute enough to be amazed by what he read. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;You
				watched Dawkins,&quot; he said to Gus later. &quot;When you were how
				old?&quot; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;I
				was young.&quot; The twelve year old, with a solemn expression, shook
				her head. &quot;But I remembered it.&quot; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;Mm.
				I don't think&mdash;&quot; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;He's <i>real</i>,
				you know. I saw him in town last week.&quot; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;Quite.&quot;
				Brownspell was bemused. &quot;He works here, doesn't he? In the
				university.&quot; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	It
				was the first time Gus realised that Oxford could be a special place. <br />

				<br />
				Perhaps
				the fuss would have died down, kept Gus's life more normal, if this
				had not been an inspection week. But Alex Duggen was the inspector,
				and he was a young man who was overly sensitive to the annoyance he
				was causing to already overworked teachers. Across the country,
				politically motivated or well-intentioned curriculum changes
				(depending on who you talked to) meant that teachers were putting in
				long unpaid hours to prepare internal reports as well as lesson
				material; the feeling was of rampant bureaucracy gone mad. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	And
				Duggen, who had not so long ago been an idealistic neophyte teacher
				himself, welcomed any excuse to get involved with an issue which did
				not revolve around paperwork or failed administration. A problem
				child, or one of exceptional promise &ndash; in this case of
				suspected plagiarism, it could be either &ndash; would form a welcome
				break from a routine he was beginning to hate. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	He
				interviewed Gus in the art room, keeping her back 'for a small chat'
				after the others had left for morning break. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Afterwards,
				with a strange delight in his eyes, he showed his &ndash; or rather
				Gus's &ndash; trophies in the staff-room: geometric models formed of
				plasticine and bright plastic cocktail sticks. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;A
				hypercube.&quot; Brownspell recognised one of the forms. &quot;But
				what's this one?&quot; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;She's
				read about tesseracts. Then extended the notion, all by herself &quot;
				&ndash; Duggen blinked &ndash; &quot;to hypertetrahedra and
				hyperpentahedra.&quot; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;Well.&quot;
				Brownspell slowly smiled. &quot;What are we going to do with her?&quot; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;Hmm?
				Indeed.&quot; Duggen's answering smile grew wide. &quot;Did you know
				Dawkins is giving a public lecture tomorrow night? In the Zoology
				Institute.&quot; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;Perhaps&quot;
				&ndash; Brownspell glanced over at Jenny Mensch, who taught French &ndash;
				&quot;a couple of us could take her there.&quot; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;What
				about Gus's parents? What do you know about them?&quot; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;A
				single mother. Works two, maybe three cleaning jobs.&quot; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;Ah.&quot;
				Duggen thought about the child's indictment of genetic determinism.
				&quot;How very interesting.&quot; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	  <i>E.O.
				Wilson showed powerful forces</i>,
				the twelve year old Gus had written,   <i>moving
				every species. But we are human beings and our lives are more
				interesting than ants.</i> <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;Gus's
				mother is devoted to her. You can tell just by the way she looks at
				her.&quot; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;That's
				very good.&quot; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;You
				think we ought to have a word with her?&quot; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;Yes...
				Yes, I think we should.&quot; <br />

				<br />
				<b>London,
				1844</b> <br />
				Ada,
				Countess of Lovelace, stares at the orange crackling fire, at the
				sheet of paper burning, becoming ash which leaps upwards, falls back.
				Outside the window, darkness has settled on fog-bound St James'
				Square. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;Madam?&quot;
				A discreet cough. &quot;Are you indisposed?&quot; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;Not
				according to the good Doctor Locock,&quot; she answers. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;I
				will let our guests know,&quot; says William, &quot;that you will be
				along shortly.&quot; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;Please
				do, sir.&quot; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Her
				husband William, Lord King, 1st Earl of Lovelace, nods politely. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	  <i>What
				have I done?</i> <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	She
				sees her husband's real concern, and wishes that she could have been
				true to him, not given to the dark, wild, reckless passions she has
				inherited from her genius father. During her entire childhood, her
				stern unforgiving mother, Annabella, kept Ada forcibly away from the
				tempestuous Byronic verses: drove her relentlessly down this other
				path, of cold logic and objective mathematics. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Except
				that equations   <i>burn</i>
				inside Ada, as insanely bright as any visions the Deity (or Lucifer)
				heaped upon her mad, bad father, whose bones now lie safely interred
				in the family vault. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	  <i>O,
				my son. What have I done?</i> <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	But
				there is no room in society for the child she has delivered. The
				other three &ndash; legitimate, everyone assumes &ndash; are well
				loved. She cannot allow herself to believe that their father was any
				other than her husband, the well-meaning William. His house gives her
				freedom from her repressive mother: the liberty she has always longed
				for. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Last
				month she gave birth, without her husband's knowledge. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	It
				is an illness which causes her wild weight fluctuations, and that
				malady has allowed her to hide the pregnancy. Inspired by a penny
				dreadful, a cheaply sensational novel in which a woman had not
				realised she was   <i>en
				ceinte</i>
				until the baby put in his appearance, Ada has kept the secret. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Too,
				it is because of her insane cycles of extreme weight gain followed
				by catastrophic loss, that William has chosen not to be intimate with
				her, his wife, for over a year. By the will of Providence, they have
				spent much of that time living in separate houses. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Now,
				one way or another, the child must disappear. <br />

				<br />
				Ada
				has a wild scheme in her head for financing the child's life. A
				gambling syndicate, using the power of her logic and Mr Babbage's
				Difference Engine, seeded with money from William. She has always
				been able to persuade him: by her forcefulness, by his genuine love
				for her. And she will need William's written permission to gamble in
				society, since a woman owns little of her own and it is the husband,
				always, who owns debts incurred by his family, as surely as he holds
				title to the capital he has inherited, to the monies earned from his
				own hard labours. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;You'll
				join us shortly, madam?&quot; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;Oh,
				yes, dearest William.&quot; She sips from her claret. &quot;That I
				will.&quot; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Her
				doctor no longer prescribes laudanum. Ada's current medication is a
				strict regime of hot baths and small doses of claret, taken
				constantly throughout the day. It appears to be efficacious. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	In
				the flames which curl and lick inside the fireplace, this is the
				vision she sees: two scurrying figures in the nightbound dockyards,
				with a small well-wrapped bundle in their arms. Sometimes the baby
				cries, sometimes it is silent; either way, misery surrounds it as
				surely as the cold damp fog settles on the city she is growing to
				hate. <br />

				<b>Oxford,
				2004</b> <br />
				Bright
				lights, white walls, and the gabble of cheerful, energetic voices. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Gus
				picked at her tub of Ben &amp; Jerry's 'One Sweet Whirled', intent
				more on the bright babble of ice cream bar conversation surrounding
				her than the dessert itself. The other students were so much older &ndash;
				eighteen, even twenty &ndash; that she had reverted to her quiet
				ways. Around the various colleges, three or four other undergraduates
				were very young; one of them, like Gus, was only fourteen. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	The
				others had been featured in their local newspapers or even the
				national press; their parents seemed to be teachers or chairmen of
				small but successful software outfits. Perhaps parental pressure
				drove them to achieve. For Gus, at home, this was not a factor; she
				knew only that her mother loved her. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Here,
				on wall-boards, a cacophony of brightly coloured notices announced
				plays, books for sale, a demonstration against world debt (which, on
				closer examination, had already taken place), used PCs for sale. A
				small yellow sheet caught her eye: JDK, she thought it read, before
				realizing her mistake &ndash; in fact it was a demonstration of
				something called JKD. Hardly interesting. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	It
				was five years since Gus had logged on to   <i>www.java.sun.com</i>
				and downloaded the basic Java Development Kit (already an outmoded
				name, but serious coders mostly still called it the JDK, rather than
				SDK) onto her school's battered old PC. And taught herself real
				programming. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	At
				her table, the talk had moved from sex to Kant's Critique of Pure
				Reason; to Professor Schama's thesis that women were the driving
				force behind cultural change in nineteenth century England (even
				before they achieved suffrage); to the post-acid house latin revival
				in general and El Phase-Transition's lead singer, N. Rapt, in
				particular; and back to sex. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Gus
				stared around the packed ice cream bar, feeling out of place. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;Excuse
				me,&quot; she said to no one in particular, and slipped away from her
				seat. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	She
				passed the notice board, scanned the yellow sheet announcing a JKD
				demonstration &ndash; some kind of kung fu: nothing at all to do with
				programming; you had to laugh &ndash; and pressed her way through to
				the exit. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Outside,
				on Little Trendy Street, she turned left, tucked her hands into her
				pockets, and began to walk. (A towny or a tourist would have called
				the narrow road Little Clarendon Street, unaware of the separate,
				insiders' geographical nomenclature known only to students and
				faculty.) The street, by whichever name, was dark and touched by
				mist. Gus shivered. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;&mdash;some
				change, please?&quot; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	A
				small youth, scarcely bigger than Gus, was sitting on a blanket in a
				doorway, with a black retriever curled up on his lap. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;Sure.&quot;
				Gus had very little money &ndash; now, or any time &ndash; but
				perhaps that sharpened her senses in some way. She knew real,
				desperate poverty when she saw it. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	She
				handed over some coins. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;Thanks,
				miss.&quot; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;No
				problem.&quot; She liked the American sound of that: like something
				from the movies. &quot;Take it easy.&quot; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	She
				walked on. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	  <i>Something...</i> <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Usually,
				this close to the city centre, the streets were safe. But there was a
				rustle as she passed the bushes by Wellington Square, and she
				stopped. Her skin prickled&mdash; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Then
				a heavy hand grabbed her sleeve. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;Hey,
				chickie. Should we be out after dark?&quot; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Stink
				of breath, close to her. Gus choked. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	And
				another voice, slimy, behind her: &quot;Gimme, now!&quot; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	  <i>Help
				me!</i> <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Fear
				paralysed Gus's throat, her mouth wide but silent, like a dying fish.
				Her mind would not process what was happening as big shapes
				manhandled her. Gus was utterly helpless. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	  <i>I
				don't want to...</i> <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;Hey!&quot;
				An echoing voice. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Sound
				of a dog, barking. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;<i>Teasing bitch...</i>&quot; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Impact
				on her face. Spurt of warm blood in mouth. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Then
				they were gone, vanished into the thickening fog, while she sat back,
				stunned, on cold paving-stones. Beside Gus, the young homeless man
				squatted, careful not to touch her. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;Are
				you all right?&quot; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	His
				dog growled at the departed muggers once more, then looked at Gus,
				stopped, swallowed wetly, then licked her face. <br />

				<br />
				<b>London,
				1844</b> <br />
				St
				Catherine's Dock is dark. Two figures hurry across the cobblestones:
				Aldo Guillermi, muffled against the cold, carrying a cane which he is
				careful not to tap against the ground, and his sister, Maria. The
				baby, wrapped in her shawl, is silent. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;Aldo,
				we will be late. If it sails, what of our baggage?&quot; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;Hush.
				They won't throw it off.&quot; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;But...&quot; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;It
				sails, and we sail on board.&quot; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	But
				their voices carry, and dark figures step from the shadows behind a
				pile of netting and crates. There are three of them, big and burly,
				with short heavy jackets over their tunics, and heavy belaying-pins
				in their hands. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;Well,
				mates.&quot; The first one spits a long stream of something dark onto
				the dockyard stones. &quot;We've found a new friend, looks like.&quot; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;No.&quot;
				Guillermi raises his empty left hand, placating. &quot;Sirs, I
				cannot. We're about to sail.&quot; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;'At's
				what I said, innit?&quot; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Press-gang?
				Or worse? <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;I'm
				sorry.&quot; Guillermi adjusts his grip on the walking-cane. &quot;I
				don't understand. Could you repeat that, please?&quot; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;You
				deaf, or what? I said&mdash;&quot; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	The
				cane whips down and up, in an instant: downwards, across the leader's
				right hand, then uses the rebound to arc backhand across the man's
				face. His belaying-pin clatters on the cobblestones. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;<i>Maria,
				go...</i>  &quot; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	They
				are almost upon him, but Guillermi sidesteps, leading them away from
				his sister. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;Get
				'im.&quot; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
				A fencing-lunge, and he stabs the cane's point into a second
				attacker's throat, followed with a savate side-kick into the lower
				ribs. The man doubles up, but his mate has already seized Guillermi's
				arms from behind, the grip unbreakable. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	  <i>Strike
				like lightning...</i> <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Guillermi
				snaps his head backwards, feels the crunch of broken nose against the
				back of his skull. Stamps downwards, arcs his elbow back &ndash;
				impact &ndash; and spins away. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	  <i>...and
				roar like thunder.</i> <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Charlemont's
				never-forgotten words, as he drove his students to fight, scream now
				in Guillermi's brain. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;<i>Yaaah!</i>&quot; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	His
				warrior-yell startles all three attackers. A circular   <i>fouett&eacute;</i>,
				a whipping kick into a thigh muscle, and the first is down, leg
				paralysed. Guillermi spins to one side &ndash; half-heard: &quot;I've
				got 'im&quot; &ndash; then his heel takes another in the throat,
				quicker than thought, in a beautiful   <i>revers</i>.
				Then an arcing series of   <i>la
				canne</i>
				strikes drops the leader. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	All
				three men are down. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	A
				civilized man would stop now, but a soldier knows better. If his
				attackers have other weapons, this is the moment when they will use
				them. So Guillermi &ndash; as has been drilled into him &ndash; does
				not stop, but whirls and stamps onto ribs, onto heads, whips the cane
				downwards again and again, until the threat is gone. <br />

				<br />
				He
				began training in   <i>le
				savate</i>
				with spoiled young gentlemen, in a somewhat effete salon, during his
				Sorbonne days. But he moved on to study with the huge powerful
				champion Charlemont, who regularly lifted small cannon barrels
				overhead, and whose instruction was practical and deadly. In later
				years, Guillermi practiced in the sun-drenched south, in the dockyard
				style of rough Marseilles, where sporting rules have never applied. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	One
				of his attackers is curled up on his side, hands around his damaged
				knees, mewling, with a long wicked knife beside him. Guillermi kicks
				the blade across damp cobbles, out of reach. Another man lies still,
				softly snoring as though asleep. The third...	 <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Moves! <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Guillermi
				leaps back, startled by a flash of light &ndash;   <i>blade</i>
				&ndash; and then a crack of sound. And the man slumps once more upon
				the cold dockyard cobblestones. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;Maria!
				Are you all right?&quot; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Like
				a marionette with severed strings, the corpse lies with twisted neck,
				a pool of dark liquid expanding beneath its lifeless head. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;Yes,
				my brother.&quot; Blue steel glints in her hand, beneath the baby's
				form. &quot;Let's go.&quot; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Her
				voice is very calm, as she slips the dark, six-inch derringer pistol
				out of sight. It is a muzzle-loaded 1807 Deringer Phila, blued steel
				inset in polished wood: a percussion cap pocket gun which requires a
				steady hand and careful aiming. Guillermi is impressed. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	  <i>Some
				good will come of this.</i> <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	It
				is a strange thought for a protective brother to have. Yet Maria's
				hysteria is suddenly gone, along with the dark depression of recent
				days: replaced by a quiet determination. And somehow her renewed
				spirit has kept the baby &ndash; the newborn boy she must protect &ndash;
				from crying. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;Yes.
				Three days,&quot; he tells her, &quot;and we'll see Maman once more.&quot; <br />

				<br />
				<b>Oxford,
				2006</b> <br />
				There
				was a lecture to commemorate some obscure academic event &ndash; the
				anniversary of someone else's lecture &ndash; and it began with a
				boring recitation of the history of computing. The lecturer's accent
				was transatlantic, and his name was Ives, but Gus knew nothing of his
				work. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;And,
				before Turing's life was tragically cut short in 1954, hounded by
				society to his death, though he almost certainly did more than any
				other single man to ensure Allied victory in World War II...&quot; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Gus's
				skin prickled. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	  <i>Turing
				was here, in this place,</i>
				she realized.   <i>He
				was real.</i> <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Buried
				in Ives' tone, she thought, was a resentment towards the society
				which had caused the mathematician's suicide. Perhaps not everyone in
				the room detected it &ndash; most of her colleagues were waiting in
				good-natured boredom for the meat of the lecture to follow &ndash;
				but on some level several of them did. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Ives
				was a visiting research fellow, and Gus followed his talk with
				interest: a brave attempt to bridge the conflicting software
				paradigms of formal specification languages and evolutionary
				algorithms. Most of the people sitting near Gus were Z experts, used
				to formulating system definitions with rigorous symbolic logic: they
				frowned at the anti-reductionist notion of creating code which had
				evolved, not been designed. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Gus
				was fascinated. <br />

				<br />
				Afterwards,
				she found herself among a small group of faculty and students
				drinking tea in the hallway outside the lecture theatre. When someone
				suggested relocating to a common room, Ives put down his half-drunk
				tea, looking relieved, then made the counter-proposal of coffee in
				Starbucks. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;My
				treat,&quot; he said, which swayed the balance. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;<i>Authors
				and academics,</i>&quot;
				he would tell Gus at a later date, &quot;<i>are
				easily swayed by the promise of free drink or food.</i>&quot; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;<i>Pavlovian
				conditioning,</i>&quot;
				she would reply. &quot;<i>And
				the desire to meet like minds: let's be fair.</i>  &quot; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	The
				coffee house was teeming with energy. While the rest of the group
				went upstairs to stake out a claim on seats, Gus volunteered to help
				Ives carry the collection of cappuccinos, frappuccinos, tea &ndash;
				that last for old Crichton, of course &ndash; and lattes,  which
				someone had pointed out was a bag of bevvies.
				<br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;I
				was hoping,&quot; said Ives, leaning on the delivery counter, &quot;to
				have a conversation free of maths humour, for a change.&quot; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	A
				'bag' was technically correct: a mathematical set where duplication
				was allowed but sequencing was irrelevant &ndash; both Jim and
				Maureen had ordered venti lattes, and it didn't matter which of the
				two drinks either person took. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;No
				chance of that round here.&quot; Gus was surprised at her own
				boldness. &quot;If you want normality, head north.&quot; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;Or
				just outwards, yeah. Town and gown. I love this old place.&quot; Ives
				had chosen to wear a bright red tie, and he was now running his
				finger inside his shirt collar, and looking uncomfortable. &quot;Less
				formal than I expected. I was doing some consultancy at a place in
				London, and everyone was wearing business suits.&quot; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;You
				might as well take the tie off,&quot; said Gus. &quot;Visiting the
				empire's last bastion must have misled you.&quot; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;Right.
				Here, it's just like home. I'm the only guy in this city who's
				wearing one.&quot; He tugged it, pulling the knot too tight, in his
				effort to undo it. &quot;Damn. You know, I had to consciously work
				out the theory behind this, but I only modelled the putting-it-on
				operation.&quot; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	So
				much for an evening without maths humour. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;Let
				me.&quot; Surprised again at her own actions, she reached up &ndash;
				aware of his close warmth &ndash; and undid the knot. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;Thanks.
				You realize there are more than eighty ways to tie one of these
				things?&quot; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;Really?&quot;
				Gus frowned in concentration, social niceties forgotten. It had
				become a technical problem, and that was interesting. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;A
				handy way to model knot topology,&quot; Ives said, stuffing the
				discarded tie in his jacket pocket, &quot;is to consider the knot's
				context, the space around it.&quot; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;Oh,
				yes. Model the not-knots. I've heard of that...&quot; <br />

				<br />
				When
				the drinks arrived, they carried everything upstairs and found their
				colleagues gathered on wooden chairs and armchairs around a small
				table, discussing the constraints placed by Goedel's Theorem on some
				branch of research which Gus had never heard of. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	  <i>Do
				I really belong here?</i> <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	It
				was a question she asked herself often. But then some maths or
				physics or computation problem &ndash; they were all the same to her
				&ndash; would crop up, and she would be lost in the joy of solving
				it. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	  <i>I
				should get home now.</i> <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;&mdash;your
				opinion?&quot; Ives was asking her. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;Sorry.
				I was thinking of something else.&quot; Gus put down the empty cup
				she realized she was holding. &quot;I ought to be going.&quot; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Ives
				looked at her for a moment. Just then, they were in an isolated
				bubble of silence while animated conversation sparkled all around
				them. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;What's
				wrong?&quot; he asked. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	  <i>How
				did you know?</i>
				She was so used to hiding the details of her life. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;My
				mother... She's not well.&quot; Gus blinked. She had not told anyone.
				&quot;They've examined her at the Radcliffe Infirmary, and they don't
				know what's wrong. Or they're not telling us.&quot; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;Oh.&quot;
				Ives put down his own drink. &quot;Where's home?&quot; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Gus
				told him. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;You've
				got a car?&quot; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;No.
				We&mdash;&quot; Gus shook her head. &quot;We can't afford one. And I
				can't drive.&quot; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;Ah,
				right.&quot; Ives stood up and turned to the rest of the group. &quot;I'll
				be back shortly. Just going to run Gus home, is that all right?&quot; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	She
				had not realized he even knew her name. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;I'm
				parked in St Giles,&quot; he added. &quot;Major achievement.&quot; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	He
				left with Gus, whether it was all right with the others or not. <br />

				<br />
				In
				the car, as they were travelling, he told her about Seattle: &quot;You'd
				love it. Friendly city, great campus.&quot; He'd delivered various
				anecdotes about consultancy work for a software giant, during the
				course of the lecture and later. &quot;Starbucks in the same
				building. When I was in the Games Division, the company took us to
				the movies, whenever a sci-fi or a fantasy came out.&quot; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;Cool,&quot;
				said Gus. And then: &quot;You worked for the Games Division?&quot; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;Yeah,
				for a while. I devised scenarios for   <i>Tokugawa</i>.
				Devious politics and ninja fighting. What a hoot.&quot; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;Really.&quot; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;Hmm.&quot;
				Ives flicked a glance at her, then returned his attention to the
				road. &quot;You don't like the game?&quot; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;It's
				great, actually.&quot; With a shrug. &quot;The martial arts were a
				bit exaggerated, but that's par for the course, isn't it?&quot; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;You
				know about martial arts?&quot; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Gus's
				voice was quietly confident: &quot;I train in jeet kune do.&quot; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	  <i>Big
				hand, grabbing in the darkness...</i> <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	No
				one would ever mug her again. <br />

				<br />
				In
				the course of a very long life, Gus would have only one occasion to
				use her art on the street &ndash; or rather, on a lonely El station
				platform in Chicago, late at night on the Green Line south of the
				Loop, where a big thug attempted to beat an old man senseless with
				his own walking-stick, while his laughing buddies looked on &ndash;
				but the difference it made that night was mortal. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	She
				used a reverse-snake escrima disarm to send the stick flying to one
				side, before clawing the attacker's eyes and breaking both his knees.
				The man's six buddies, through alcohol-clouded senses, noticed that
				she was small and female, and did not process the ease with which she
				had taken the big man out. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	The
				rest happened very fast. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	In
				seconds she was spinning and circling, throwing kicks and
				elbow-strikes, firing everything she had been taught in a continuous
				blur of adrenalized motion. The last man was even bigger than the
				first, drawing a knife from his belt but too late, as Gus used the
				running side-kick which Bruce Lee had developed to blast her attacker
				right off the edge of the platform and onto the tracks, where he
				narrowly escaped fatal electrocution. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Beyond
				that one incident, the daily discipline of physical JKD training, and
				her later experimentation with neurolinguistic programming (though she later criticised the community for
				narrow, uncritical dogma), were the
				keys &ndash; she always thought &ndash; to
				her longevity and success. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	As
				for her mathematical intuition... she would never be certain whether
				such discipline helped or hindered in that regard. But when applied
				to emotional control and financial management, it would certainly
				make her rich. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Very
				rich indeed. <br />

				<br />
				That
				night in Oxford, though, as Ives was leaving her house &ndash; having
				stayed to chat with Gus and her mother, and being polite enough to
				pretend he enjoyed the dark strong tea which Mother made &ndash; Gus
				reached up to kiss him on the cheek, but he moved back subtly and she
				subsided. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;I
				am single,&quot; he told her. &quot;But, you know... Most guys, at my
				age, are either married or gay.&quot; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	It
				took a while for that to sink in. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;Oh.&quot; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Ives
				smiled. &quot;Just so long as you know.&quot; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	He
				shook her hand then, while her cheeks flared red. Over the decades,
				it was only the first of many shared incidents they would have cause
				to chuckle over. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	And
				that was the first night she dreamed of knots. <br />

				<br />
				<b>Provence,
				1848</b> <br />
				Medora
				stands at the window, looking out at the unseasonal rain falling upon
				the courtyard, thinking of England, which she will never see again. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;It's
				a time of revolution,&quot; one of the other two women says.
				&quot;According to Aldo, this is the year the world will change.&quot; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Medora,
				painfully thin but strong now, turns slowly around. The woman who
				spoke, Alicia, is heavily pregnant. Seated by the pale stone
				fireplace, she rests one limp hand on the hemispherical bulge of her
				stomach. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	  <i>I
				should no longer regard you,</i>
				Medora thinks,   <i>as
				my servant.</i> <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	She
				looks up at Aldo's sister, Maria, and they share wan smiles. They
				grew fond of Alicia when she came up from the village to help out,
				right from the very first day. Doing more work than she was supposed
				to. Chatting with Aldo about politics and history. Medora and Maria
				saw, long before Alicia and Aldo realized it themselves, that the
				young couple had fallen deeply in love. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	  <i>All
				three of us are sisters now.</i> <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	There
				is the family you are born into &ndash; in Medora's case, a dark
				calamitous beginning: the Byrons are truly cursed &ndash; and the
				family which, if you are a survivor, you get to choose.	It has taken
				Medora a long time to realize this, but she knows it is true. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;He'll
				come back safely,&quot; she tells Alicia. &quot;Don't worry.&quot; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Alicia
				nods, but Maria turns away. Since Aldo rode off to fight, she has
				been subject to moods of deep introspection. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	  <i>God
				will give me strength.</i>
				Medora puts her hand against her chest, pressing the hidden crucifix
				against her skin.   <i>Even
				if I am damned, let me help these in need.</i> <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	In
				the past, she was always so weak and useless, going to her hated aunt
				&ndash; and to the woman who is both her cousin and her half-sister,
				Ada, Countess of Lovelace &ndash; for handouts, in desperation. But
				now, in the modest vineyard, she no longer exists in the eyes of
				English (or European) high society. The sins of her parents are no
				longer public gossip: they are between her and God. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	For
				Medora's mother was Augusta Byron &ndash; the woman after whom
				Augusta Ada Byron, now the Countess of Lovelace, was named &ndash;
				and everyone knows, though no one says, that Augusta's own brother,
				the famous, devil-driven poet, was the unacknowledged father of her
				bastard girl-child. <br />

				<br />
				It
				was Ada who arranged for Medora's relocation to this remote place.
				And now, since she sent this new child to be raised forever in
				secret, there has been no contact at all with England. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	  <i>I
				pray to God that it remains so.</i> <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Here
				in southern France, Medora is known as the Widow Calzonni. Four year
				old Jean-Pierre, asleep upstairs, is supposed to be the son she bore
				to a dead fictitious husband; Maria was his wet-nurse. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Will
				they ever tell Jean-Pierre of his true parents? That his mother was
				Ada, the Countess of Lovelace, while his father was Dr Crosse, son of
				the man said to have created life from base matter? <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	It
				is a decision Medora has not yet made. <br />

				<br />
				&quot;I
				dreamed of Aldo.&quot; Alicia places both hands on her swollen womb.
				&quot;He was bouncing our daughter on his knee, and she was
				laughing.&quot; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;A
				sign from Providence.&quot; Maria crosses herself. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	But,
				in the event, it will be two years before they see Aldo again,
				although his child will indeed be a daughter. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	He
				will appear in the courtyard, riding bare-back upon a weary
				half-starved horse. With his right leg shattered, he will be a
				changed man at first: bitter, given to drunken rages. But later,
				bolstered by the sight of his daughter's beauty, his natural optimism
				will reassert itself. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	By
				the time of his death, his little empire of olive groves and
				vineyards will be prosperous indeed. Those riches will remain until
				the eve of World War II, when disagreements with the local   <i>fascisti</i>
				will cause everything to be lost. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	But
				now, from the village church, the Angelus bell rings out. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;Time,
				my sisters&quot; &ndash; Medora hands out well-worn missals &ndash;
				&quot;to pray.&quot; <br />

				<b>Santa
				Monica, 2024</b> <br />
				Arm
				in arm, Gus and Ives strolled slowly along the boardwalk. Late
				afternoon, with the surf rolling in below, pale seagulls gliding
				overhead. Salt tang upon the air; the fresh sea breeze washing over
				their tanned faces. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;You
				know&quot; &ndash; Gus stopped, let go of Ives, leaned over the
				balustrade, and pointed downwards &ndash; &quot;I lost my virginity
				right about there.&quot; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;Never.&quot;
				Shaking with gentle laughter, Ives looked over. &quot;After dark, I
				hope.&quot; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;Oh,
				yeah. With a nice post-doc, since you wouldn't oblige.&quot; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;Right.
				I can still see the damp spot.&quot; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;Ho,
				ho.&quot; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	They
				were celebrating, in a fashion: a deliberate way of experiencing
				today's events as a positive step forwards. For Ives had come home
				last night to an empty apartment. Not even a note from his departed
				lover, Raoul: just empty closets and missing cash. And invective
				scrawled in toothpaste across the bathroom mirror. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	And
				Gus had just finalized her divorce &ndash; her   <i>first</i>
				divorce, as Ives ironically (and presciently) labelled it &ndash; and
				seen her ex-husband drive away with his new girlfriend:
				large-bosomed, wearing a gaudy, shocking pink short dress, and a
				triumphant smirk upon her face. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	  <i>That'll
				disappear,</i>
				Gus reckoned,   <i>when
				she finds out who owns everything.</i> <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	For
				the beach house and Sundriver-coup&eacute; skimmer were all hers. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;We've
				come a long way,&quot; she said. &quot;Hey, that sounds dramatic,
				doesn't it?&quot; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;Both
				of us.&quot; Ives touched his new moustache: it had come out tinged
				with grey, and he was not sure whether he would keep it. &quot;I'm
				glad I met you, sweetheart.&quot; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;Likewise,
				dearest. Shall we walk to the end?&quot; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;Why
				not?&quot; As they walked on, he began to whistle softly &ndash; the
				Pattern theme, from   <i>Amber:
				the Musical</i>
				&ndash; in counterpoint to the rolling surf. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;Listen.&quot;
				Gus squeezed his arm. &quot;Are you doing anything tonight?&quot; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	A
				middle-aged couple in matching Hawaiian shirts and baggy shorts were
				staring at her and Ives, close enough to hear. She should have known
				the kind of answer she would get. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;Wearing
				you out, all night long. There's a position I've been meaning to&mdash;&quot; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	But
				the couple walked on then, offended, and there was no point in
				completing the sentence. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;Oops.&quot;
				Ives raised his eyebrows. &quot;Was it something I said?&quot; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;Ha.
				Is it just me, or are people more repressed than when I was younger?
				Even here?&quot; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;Probably.&quot;
				Ives looked gloomy for a moment, then cheered up, and gestured at the
				wide ocean. &quot;Look at that. Are we lucky to be alive, or what?&quot; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;Yes,
				lucky.&quot; She squeezed his arm again. &quot;Thanks for being
				alive, my friend.&quot; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	She
				was nearly twenty five, and single once more. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	  <i>Saved
				from a big mistake.</i> <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;We're
				good for each other.&quot; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;Oh,
				yes.&quot; <br />

				<br />
				Their
				minds were both similar and complementary. When Gus developed the
				concepts behind <i>Fractal
				of the Beast</i>,
				it was Ives who helped brainstorm the network of developing
				relationships among the characters. She devised the aliens' forms, he
				worked out the structure of the shadow organization which fought
				them. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	She
				coded the game; he negotiated the license rights. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	From
				that first product, Ives insisted that he make no money directly. He
				already had his earnings from lucrative consultancy; she had nothing.
				&quot;<i>But
				I'll be rich,</i>&quot;
				he said, as they signed a deal giving him twenty percent of earnings
				from any future games they might develop together. &quot;<i>And
				so will you.</i>  &quot; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	For
				the first six months, download figures were minimal. Then, in a fit
				of nostalgia or desperation, one of the big webnets started promoting
				a remake of the old <i>X-Files</i> shows, and the whole half-forgotten alien-invasion meme had come
				alive once more, and sales had rocketed. <br />

				<br />
				Those
				fictional invaders would prove more important than anyone realized. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	The
				alien hunt in the game proceeded through many levels. The stories
				were labyrinthine; a dark and gloomy sense of being watched was
				present in almost every scene; and there was action, with tricky
				clues to decipher. Only three players, since the game's release over
				four years before, ever reached the final level. (Unless there was
				someone else, with an offline copy of the game, who never hooked in
				with the rest of the world.) <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	But
				three users' systems had automatically mailed her when they
				deciphered the final puzzle. She sent each of them a rather
				substantial amount of money, though the game did not advertise the
				existence of such a prize. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	One
				of the three was Arvin Rubens, a proteg&eacute; of David Hall &ndash;
				and Arvin himself, when still a teenager, had met Hall's mentor, the
				legendary  Richard Feynman &ndash; and he transferred the money back
				to her, with a note saying that he had no need for it. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;<i>I'd
				only get myself into trouble,</i>&quot;
				he said in an updated Feynmanism, &quot;<i>by
				spending it on wine, women and a new holoterminal.</i>&quot; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	He
				also invited both her and Ives to come and work with him in Caltech. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Sunshine,
				sea. She could train in JKD at the Inosanto Academy. Why would she
				want to stay in old, cold Oxford? <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;<i>Even
				if you don't come,</i>&quot;
				Rubens had told her, &quot;<i>you've
				already helped my research.</i>&quot; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	For
				the game's final solution involved working out the aliens' true
				nature. They appeared in many shapes and guises, but the key lay in
				realizing that each was a different projection of one fractal shape &ndash;
				a single being of dimension 6.66 &ndash; into ordinary spacetime.
				Just as, in the Pickover book which Gus read in childhood, five
				disconnected blobs appearing on the surface of a Flatland balloon
				might really be fingerprints from a single, otherwordly hand. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	And
				the underlying equation was useful because it came directly out of
				Gus's own research at Oxford, into the fundamental nature of the
				spacetime continuum. <br />

				<br />
				&quot;Come
				back to my place,&quot; she said to Ives, as they turned back from
				the end of the boardwalk. &quot;I've got something to show you.&quot; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;Whoopee.&quot;
				Then, &quot;House or lab, do you mean?&quot; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;I
				mean the lab, darling. Sorry to disappoint.&quot; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	As
				they passed a row of bright pastel houses, a drunk came shambling up
				to them, hand outstretched.   <i>If
				you give me money,</i>
				the display on his write-capable t-shirt read,   <i>I'll
				spend it on booze. But at least I'm honest.</i> <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;Here
				you are.&quot; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Blinking
				in the sunshine, the drunk stood looking at the money in his hand &ndash;
				from both of them &ndash; as Gus and Ives walked on. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;If
				we asked him to tell us how he ended up here,&quot; said Ives, &quot;I
				wonder what he'd say.&quot; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;Let's
				not go there.&quot; Gus used her watch to summon a cab. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;All
				right.&quot; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	They
				waited silently until a vehicle slid to the curb, and its gull-wing
				door swung up. Gus slid inside first, announcing their destination
				loudly to the cab's AI, knowing that her vestigial accent could cause
				recognition problems. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Ives
				crossed his arms, as the door descended and the street began to slide
				past. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;People
				always draw family trees,&quot; Gus said suddenly, as though she
				herself had not told him to drop the topic of past lives, &quot;upside
				down. Or hadn't you noticed?&quot; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;<i>Qu&eacute;?</i>&quot;
				Ives spread his hands. &quot;<i>No
				comprendo.</i>
				Sorry.&quot; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;Branching
				out downwards, with increasing time. But the further back you go, the
				  <i>more</i>
				ancestors you have.&quot; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;Right.
				Ten generations back&mdash;&quot; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;You
				have a thousand and twenty four ancestors.&quot; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;Assuming
				no incest. Yee-hah. You know you're a redneck when&mdash;&quot; Ives
				stopped, looked at her, then patted her hand. &quot;Gus, dear. It
				wasn't your fault. It wasn't anybody's. Life just turns out like
				that.&quot; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;I
				know.&quot; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	But
				Gus's sudden wealth had come too late to keep her mother alive.
				  <i>Genetic
				defect in the heart</i>,
				the consultant had told her.   <i>The
				neuro-degeneration weakened her, and we still don't know the cause of
				that.</i> <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Silent
				tears, unbidden, tracked down Gus's cheeks. <br />

				<br />
				A
				holo landscape half-filled the room, hanging above the desktop and
				extending outwards, so that Ives appeared to be standing in the
				middle of a mountain range. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;I've
				modified here, and here.&quot; Gus pointed at additional
				free-floating holovolumes in which equations scrolled. &quot;But it's
				little different from the standard mosaic.&quot; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	The
				landscape represented a simplified 3-dimensional spacetime &ndash; 2
				spatial, 1 time &ndash; as an overall brane, formed of interwoven
				sub-branes. Gus pointed at the 'zoom' icon. The image expanded until
				gaps were visible: the holes between linked Planck-length tessellae
				which form the vacuum itself. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;I
				reworked the topology&quot; &ndash; Gus smiled &ndash; &quot;using
				not-knots. Remember them?&quot; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;Ah,
				yes.&quot; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	The
				image flipped into a kind of mirror-converse. What had seemed a
				landscape was now a moir&eacute;e pattern draped across something
				else: an underlying jagged sub-landscape which supported reality. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;Then
				I got more interested in the continuum's context than in spacetime
				itself. Modelling the not-knot&mdash;&quot; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Ives
				nodded. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;The
				power of metaphor. Well done, dear.&quot; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Faraday
				used the notion of fields purely as a metaphor, explaining
				electromagnetic action at a distance. Yet modern researchers thought
				of fields as the underlying reality, while everything else &ndash;
				particles, twistors, branes, tessellae &ndash; was illusion.
				Physicists gained the concept   <i>'with
				their mother's milk'</i>  ,
				as Einstein said. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	But
				Gus's work changed the metaphor. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	In
				her model, the eleven dimensions of realspace were the illusory
				projection, draped across the underlying fractal context which shapes
				both this and other universes. She had a name for the context:
				mu-space. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;The
				ultimate continuum,&quot; she said. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;If
				you're right, there's a Nobel prize in&mdash;&quot; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;And
				I've already sent a signal through it.&quot; <br />

				<b>Ashley
				Combe, 1852</b> <br />

				flames crackle in the fireplace. A vision of eternal Hell awaiting

				laudanum intoxication: it is the crab, this disease which is killing
				her. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;My
				father&mdash;&quot; Ada's voice is a whimper. &quot;I want to be
				buried&mdash;with him.&quot; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;Hush,
				my dear.&quot; A hand pats hers. &quot;That will be taken care of.&quot; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	For
				a moment, she does not know who this is: William, perhaps Andrew
				Crosse, or Faraday... Last week, she believes, her old friend Dickens
				read to her. To <i>her</i>.
				Daughter of the great poet, but a strange, maddened fool in her own
				right. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	  <i>I've
				done so much wrong.</i> <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Has
				Charles Babbage been to see his failing Queen of Engines, his dying
				Enchantress of Numbers? But it is John Crosse, her former lover, who
				is with her now. For a time, her old friends were barred from
				visiting; now it is too late for foolishness. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	  <i>It
				hurts&mdash;</i> <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Her
				body is soaked. William and her sons &ndash; her three acknowledged
				sons &ndash; have been pouring cold water upon her bared, so-thin
				midriff to ease the pain. But for now, only Crosse is here with her. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;I
				received a letter,&quot; he whispers. &quot;About... Jean-Pierre.   <i>Our
				son thrives</i>  .
				He thrives, my love.&quot; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	  <i>My
				son?</i> <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;He
				has a constant playmate,&quot; Crosse adds. &quot;Daughter of the man
				who took him abroad. Giuliani? Something like that. Someday, says
				Medora, they'll be&mdash;&quot; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	The
				whimpering begins again. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	  <i>My
				son!</i> <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Ada
				fights the pain, but neither guile nor ferocity will beat this last,
				implacable foe. Finally, though it takes two more pain-wracked days,
				metastasized cervical cancer shuts down her internal organs one by
				one, her ragged breath rattles, and she lies still. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	In
				the fireplace, lowering flames sputter. Grey ash spills upon the
				floor. <br />

				<br />
				It
				was perhaps a mesmeric demonstration, at a soir&eacute;e held on her
				twenty sixth birthday, which opened the Pandora's box of Ada's mind,
				released the dark spirit which could never be contained again. She
				blamed that experiment &ndash; undertaken for sensation's sake &ndash;
				and her own impetuous nature for all that followed. Equations burned,
				pure thoughts soared, but her inner drives would always deny her
				peace. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Years
				earlier, her father's body, with massive pageantry, was conveyed by
				carriage, drawn by six black steeds, through London's streets (which
				were thronged with onlookers), and laid to rest in the family vault.
				Ada's own funeral is more modest; her narrow corpse travels by modern
				train, black smoke billowing in lieu of stallion's manes. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Finally,
				she lies interred beside the father she was not allowed to know. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Crosse,
				meanwhile, crouches beneath his mantelpiece, burning, one by one,
				every letter he received from the woman he loved, and every note from
				the forgotten half-sister entrusted with raising their secret child:
				the son he will never see. <br />

				<br />
				<b>Santa

				That
				night, her demonstration seemed nothing special. Gus shone red laser
				light into her kludged lab-bench setup &ndash; draining power from
				the campus mesoreactor: she would get complaints &ndash; where the
				beam simply disappeared. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	But,
				at the far end of the half-lit lab, a red spot glowed in mid-air. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	To
				an onlooker, it would have seemed the simplest of holograms. Ives
				whistled as he examined the apparatus; whatever the underlying
				mechanism, the results were spectacular. Red light shone into
				nothingness, reappeared some seven yards away. He realized, though it
				would take decades for other minds to catch up all the way with his
				intuition, that this simple demonstration transformed everything. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Shortly
				before dawn, they were back at the beach, sitting upon damp sand,
				breathing in the ocean air. Stars still glittered overhead, though
				dark-green painted the horizon behind them. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;We're
				going to get there.&quot; Ives, craning back, stared straight up.
				&quot;Thanks to you.&quot; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;I
				hope so.&quot; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	They
				stayed there until the rising sun draped orange fire across
				steel-grey waves, lighting the warm salt fluid which gave birth to
				life, splashing endlessly against the shore. <br />

				she told them weeks before. &quot;<i>Not
				with continuous thrust. I'll use a slow-shuttle. Perfectly safe.</i>&quot;)
				The occasional lie will not hurt them: she came up fast. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	They
				don't have her perspective on the world. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	  <i>After
				all this time.</i> <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Seventy
				eight too-short years have passed since her discovery. Lightspeed
				spinglobes, forming stasis fields within, were created a hundred and
				twenty years after Einstein's blistering insights into the
				relativistic nature of spacetime. Her own research (she does not
				consider herself in Einstein's league) has taken this long to come to
				technological fruition. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;<i>Two
				minutes, ma'am.</i>&quot;
				A respectful voice in her earpiece. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Wealth
				comes from her corporations, more than intellectual endeavours. One
				of her companies owns the patent for this bubble's material: a
				transparent paramagnetic ceramic. She has always invested ten percent
				of income, given ten percent away (to children's foundations, mainly)
				and wisely spent the rest. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	  <i>But
				none of it had meaning...</i> <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Her
				own researchers, at her insistence, use her as a guinea pig, for
				telomere replenishment and femtocytic re-engineering: for every
				life-extending treatment which looks likely to work. Equally
				importantly, she practices Yang-style t'ai chi every morning. Gus
				refuses to die too soon. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	  <i>...until
				this moment.</i> <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Dark
				space outside. She wishes Ives were here. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;  <i>One
				minute.</i>  &quot; <br />

				<br />
				She
				remembers Mother, so frail in the hospital bed, in the Radcliffe's
				terminal ward. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;<i>Why
				did you call me Augusta, Mum?</i>&quot; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	A
				long pause, then the tiniest of shrugs, from shoulders so emaciated
				her bones looked razor-sharp, attempting to cut through skin. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;<i>Family
				tradition, pumpkin&mdash;</i>&quot; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	It
				was days before Mother found final peace in death. But those were the
				last coherent words she spoke. <br />

				<br />
				Now,
				Gus watches the stars. Blackness, sprinkled with diamond stars,
				across an invisible context whose mathematical reality she knows, but
				whose tangible qualities neither she nor anyone else can see. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	  <i>Stardust,
				every one of us...</i> <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Born
				in distant suns. And all those suns seem to murmur now, as long
				forgotten technology once whispered to the girl she was: secrets she
				will never truly grasp. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;<i>Ma'am...</i>&quot; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;I
				see it.&quot; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Silver
				dart. A tiny speck, orbiting fast, high above blueness, heading
				into... <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Gone. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	One
				moment it was there; next, the vessel no longer existed. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;<i>Insertion
				complete.</i>&quot; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Hopeful,
				that message from Observation Control. There was no explosion; with
				luck, it means&mdash; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Speck. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;Is
				that it?&quot; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;<i>Beg
				your&mdash;? Yes! Ma'am, they're back.</i>&quot; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Shining
				light, growing. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	The
				silver vessel gleams, broadcasting its report of success on all
				wavelengths. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;<i>We
				saw it!</i>&quot;
				The captain's voice. &quot;<i>Alpha
				Centauri, for sure. Spectrometer confirms. We were there!</i>&quot; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;Thank
				you,&quot; Gus whispers. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	The
				silver biographer-globe drops closer, and she frowns. Then she
				realizes she is lying down, though she cannot recall changing
				position. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Blackness,
				circling all around. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	And
				the stars, so bright. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	&quot;<i>...ma'am?</i>&quot; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Sounds,
				fading. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	  <i>We
				made it, Mum.</i> <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	And,
				for a moment, she sees it: the fractal Pattern, the mu-space reality
				that holds up our illusory cosmos&mdash; <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	  <i>Thank
				you.</i> <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Somewhere,
				a major blood vessel erupts. A crack, then relief. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Stars... <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	A
				smile spreads across Gus's lined face. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	...fading... <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Her
				personal universe dwindles. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	...to
				darkness. <br />
				&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	Is
				gone. <br />
